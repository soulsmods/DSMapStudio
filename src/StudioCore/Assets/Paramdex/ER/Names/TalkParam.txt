1400000 The fallen leaves tell a story.
1400010 The great Elden Ring was shattered.
1400020 In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.
1400030 Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found,
1400040 and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was first to perish.
1400050 Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.
1400060 The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.
1400080 A war from which no lord arose.
1400090 A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.
1500000 Arise now, ye Tarnished.
1500010 Ye dead, who yet live.
1500020 The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.
1500030 Hoarah Loux, chieftain of the badlands.
1500040 The ever-brilliant Goldmask.
1500050 Fia, the Deathbed Companion.
1500060 The loathsome Dung Eater.
1500070 And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.
1500080 <blank>
2001500 Don't worry Torrent, fortune is on his side.
2001510 We found him here, after all.
2001520 One of his kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring.
2001530 ...Even if it does violate the Golden Order...
2001900 <blank>
2003000 Foul Tarnished,
2003010 In search of the Elden Ring.
2003020 Emboldened by the flame of ambition.
2003030 Hrah!
2003040 Someone must extinguish thy flame.
2003050 Let it be Margit the Fell!
2003900 <blank>
2004000 Mighty dragon, thou'rt a trueborn heir.
2004010 Lend me thy strength, o kindred.
2004020 Deliver me unto greater heights.
2004030 ...Well.
2004040 A lowly Tarnished,
2004041 playing as a lord.
2004050 I command thee, kneel!
2004060 I am the lord of all that is golden!
2004900 <blank>
2005000 <blank>
2005001 <blank>
2005010 <panting>
2005020 Ahh, truest of dragons.
2005030 Lend me thy strength...
2005040 Nnngh!
2005050 <panting>
2005060 Forefathers, one and all...
2005080 Bear witness!
2005900 <blank>
2007000 It's been a long while, Morgott.
2007010 Long and hard didst thou fight.
2007020 Tarnished Warrior.
2007021 Spurned by the grace of gold.
2007030 Be assured, the Elden Ring
2007040 resteth close at hand.
2007050 Alas, I am returned.
2007060 To be granted audience once more.
2007070 Upon my name as Godfrey,
2007080 The first Elden Lord!
2007900 <blank>
2008000 Nngh!
2008010 That will be all.
2008020 Thou didst me good service, Serosh.
2008030 I've given thee courtesy enough.
2008050 Rrraaargh!
2008060 <exhales>
2008070 Now I fight as Hoarah Loux!
2008080 Warrior!
2008900 <blank>
2009900 <blank>
2010900 <blank>
2012900 <blank>
2014000 Dearest Miquella.
2014010 You must abide alone a while.
2014520 Welcome, honoured guest.
2014530 To the birthplace of our dynasty!
2014900 <blank>
2016900 <blank>
2020900 <blank>
2021000 Foul Tarnished.
2021010 Graceless Tarnished.
2021020 What is thy business with these thrones?
2021030 Ahh...
2021040 Godrick the Golden.
2021050 The twin prodigies, Miquella and Malenia.
2021060 General Radahn.
2021070 Praetor Rykard.
2021080 Lunar Princess Ranni.
2021090 Wilful traitors, all.
2021100 Thy kind are all of a piece.
2021111 Pillagers. Emboldened by the flame of ambition.
2021120 Ngh!
2021130 Have it writ upon thy meagre grave:
2021140 Felled by King Morgott! Last of all kings.
2021900 <blank>
2023000 <blank>
2023010 O, Death.
2023020 Become my blade, once more.

2023050 <long exhalation>
2023900 <blank>
2024030 <children giggling>
2024510 Hush, little culver.
2024520 I'll soon birth thee anew, a sweeting fresh and pure...
2024900 <blank>
2025500 Ahh, my beloved...
2025510 Have no fear, I will hold thee. Patience...
2025520 Ye will be countless born, forever and ever.
2025530 Upon my name as Ranni the Witch.
2025541 Mother's rich slumber shall not be
2025550 Foul trespasser.
2025560 Send word far and wide.
2025570 Of the last Queen of Caria,
2025580 And the majesty of the night
2025900 <blank>
2026000 I dreamt for so long.
2026010 My flesh was dull gold...and my blood, rotted.
2026020 Corpse after corpse, left in my wake...
2026030 As I awaited...his return.
2026040 ...Heed my words.
2026050 I am Malenia.
2026060 And I have never known defeat.
2026900 <blank>
2027500 Wait.
2027510 The scarlet bloom flowers once more.
2027520 You will witness true horror.
2027530 Now, rot!
2027900 <blank>
2028900 <blank>
2029000 Farewell, then.
2029010 May your visit be fruitful.
2029900 <blank>
2030000 Hmm...
2030010 Very well.
2030020 You...
2030031 Join the Serpent King, as family...
2030041 Together, we will devour the very gods!

2039100 General Radahn is cursed ever to wander.
2039101 Before we begin, allow me to paint you the full picture.
2039110 Eaten from the inside, by Malenia's scarlet rot, his wits are long gone.
2039120 Now he gathers the corpses of former friends and foes alike, gorging on them, like a dog.
2039130 Howling at the sky.
2040900 <blank>
2043000 O Erdtree, you shall burn.
2043010 Burn, for the sake of the new Lord.
2043020 Thank you. For guiding me here.
2043030 The one who walks alongside flame,
2043040 Shall one day meet the road of Destined Death.
2043050 Good-bye.
2043060 I hope you will become Lord. Lord of each and all.

2045000 Aaargh! Aargh!

2045040 <great howl>
2045900 <blank>
2047900 <blank>
2048000 Now wilt ye serve, each and all.
2048001 The Elden Lord is crowned.
2048010 The new Elden Lord,
2048011 And so beginneth the age of fracture...
2048100 The fallen leaves tell a story.
2048110 Of how a Tarnished, of no renown, became Elden Lord.
2048200 The fallen leaves tell a story.
2048201 The fallen leaves tell a story.
2048202 The fallen leaves tell a story.
2048210 Of how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.
2048211 Of how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.
2048212 Of how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.
2048220 In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.
2048221 In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.
2048222 In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.
2048300 Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.
2048310 An Age of Fracture.
2048400 Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.
2048410 The Age of Order.
2048415 The Age Absolute.
2048500 Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.
2048510 The Age of the Duskborn
2048600 Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.
2048610 The reviled curse that defined our age.
2048620 The Blessing of Despair.
2048900 <blank>
2049000 ...The battle is over, I see.
2049010 I do solemnly swear.
2049020 To every living being, and every living soul.
2049030 Now cometh the age of the stars.
2049040 A thousand year voyage
2049050 Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond.
2049060 Into fear, doubt, and loneliness...
2049070 As the path stretcheth into darkness...
2049080 Well then. Shall we?
2049090 My fair consort, eternal.
2049500 ...The battle is over, I see.
2049510 I do solemnly swear.
2049520 To every living being, and every living soul.
2049530 Now cometh the age of the stars.
2049540 A thousand year voyage
2049550 Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond.
2049560 Into fear, doubt, and loneliness...
2049570 As the path stretcheth into darkness...
2049580 Let us go, together.
2049590 My dear consort, eternal.
2049900 <blank>
2050000 Lord of Frenzied Flame...
2050011 I will seek you, as far as you may travel...
2050020 To deliver you what is yours.
2050030 Destined Death.
2054000 Young seedling, young seedling.
2054010 Return to the bosom of earth.
2054020 But remember well,
2054030 Thou'rt mine.
2054040 So shall I give of myself. This is for thee.
2054050 Mine abundance, my drop of dew.
2054060 Quench thy thirst, throughout thy frame.
2054070 Blossom and burgeon, time and again.
2054080 Grow larger, stronger.
2054090 Until the day cometh.
2054100 When thou canst share in my dream.
2054110 Elden Ring, O Elden Ring.
2054120 Beget Order most elegant, from my tender reverie.
2055900 <blank>
2058000 Greetings.
2058010 Traveller from beyond the Fog.
2058020 I am Melina.
2058030 I offer you an accord.
2058900 <blank>
2058910 <blank>
2058920 <blank>

2058950 <blank>
2059900 <blank>
2062900 <blank>
2063900 <blank>
2064000 And one other. Whom grace would again bless.
2064010 A Tarnished of no renown.
2064020 Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.
2064030 to stand before the Elden Ring.
2064040 And become the Elden Lord.
2064900 <blank>
2068900 <blank>
2069900 <blank>
2070000 The Rune of Death is unbound.
2070010 Black flames have devoured the Erdtree,
2070011 and the Lands Between are shrouded by Death's dark fate.
2070020 But the flames will also burn the impenetrable thorns.
2070030 Farewell it is, then.
2070040 You'll be Elden Lord, yet.
2073000 Well, if you really are that gullible...
2073001 Ngh!
2073010 then stay away from the Volcano Manor!
2073020 Bye now!
2073030 Take care!
2073900 <blank>
2074000 <blank>
2075000 <blank>
2075010 Lord host, I could not be more content.
2075020 I found knowledge, and then found someone. That someone was you.
2075030 And now, inside you, here I am...
2076000 <blank>
2077000 Well well well?
2077010 I should have known, you scheming little thief.
2077020 The gods demand vengeance. Vengeance!
2078000 He he he he he...
2078010 My sincerest gratitude. I thought I'd never wrench that thing open.
2078020 You're the finest customer a man ever had!
2083000 <blank>
2083010 This is how you die, you disgusting Tarnished.
2083020 Don't worry, I've got big plans for you. After you snuff it...
2084000 <blank>
2084010 <blank>
2084020 <blank>
2085000 <screaming>
2085010 <blank>
2085020 <blank>
2086000 <screaming>
2086010 <blank>
2086020 (explained above)
2086030 Unleash it upon them! A cursed blessing to all!
2086040 (scream of pain)
10001000 Have you heard of the Finger Maidens?
10001001 They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished.
10001002 But you, I am afraid, are maidenless.
10001003 I can play the role of maiden.
10001004 Turning runes into strength.
10001005 To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring.
10001006 You need only take me with you.
10001007 To the foot of the Erdtree.
10001100 Then it's settled.
10001101 Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength.
10001102 Ahh, another matter.
10001103 I bequeath to you this ring.
10001105 Use it to traverse great distances.
10001106 It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent.
10001107 Torrent has chosen you.
10001108 Treat him with respect.
10001200 I understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger.
10001201 Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding.
10001202 Summon me by grace if you should reconsider.
10001300 Have you reconsidered my offer?
10002000 Shall I turn your runes to strength?
10002001 Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
10002100 <blank>
10002200 Phew. It is done.
10003000 This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree.
10003001 This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren.
10003002 But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear.
10003003 You can see them, can't you?
10003004 The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden.
10003100 Me?
10003101 I'm searching.
10003102 For my purpose, given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree, long ago.
10003103 For the reason that I yet live, burned and bodiless.
10003104 There is something for which I must apologise.
10003105 I've acted the Finger Maiden, yet can offer no guidance.
10003106 I am no maiden. My purpose�was long ago lost.
10003200 Upon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer.
10003201 A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring.
10003202 If the rays of grace signal the castle,
10003203 then the Elden Ring beckons you.
10003204 As an ally by pact,
10003205 ...I pray that you are fit...
10003206 To face the challenge presented by the Ring.
10004000 Spoken echoes linger here.
10004001 Words of Queen Marika, who vanished long ago.
10004002 If you wish, I will share them with you.
10004100 Very well. In Marika's own words.
10004101 My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.
10004102 With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.
10004103 Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.
10004104 Well? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance.
10004200 Of course. Perhaps there is no need.
10004201 Tell me if you should change your mind.
10004300 Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well.
10004301 Shall I share them with you?
10004400 In Marika's own words.
10004401 Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.
10004402 Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.
10004403 Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.
10004500 In Marika's own words.
10004501 The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine.
10004502 Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.
10004503 To wallow at the fringes, a powerless upstart.
10010100 In Marika's own words.
10010101 Hear me, Demigods. My children beloved.
10010102 Make of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord. Be it a God.
10010103 But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.
10010104 Amounting only to sacrifices...
10010200 In Marika's own words.
10010201 O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.
10010202 Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.
10010203 Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.
10010300 In Marika's own words.
10010301 I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.
10010302 Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.
10010303 Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past.
10010304 My comrades, why must ye falter?
10010400 In Marika's own words.
10010401 Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds.
10010402 Guidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand.
10010403 Put the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount.
10010404 Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.
10010405 Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!
10010500 Forgive me. I've been...testing you.
10010501 To see whether or not grace truly does guide you.
10010502 And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails.
10010503 It seems my worries were unfounded.
10010504 Torrent had your measure from the very start.
10010505 Whereas I merely pretended.
10010506 There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance.
10010507 I can take you to the Roundtable Hold...
10010508 Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...
10010600 Very well.
10010601 Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
10010700 Forgive me. I've been...testing you.
10010701 To determine if the Elden Ring would truly have you.
10010702 If you had the mettle to endure this long and arduous path.
10010703 It seems my worries were unfounded.
10010704 Torrent had your measure from the very start.
10010705 Whereas I merely pretended.
10010706 There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance.
10010707 I can take you to the Roundtable Hold...
10010708 Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...
10011000 Your seamster, Boc...
10011001 He is always eager to see your return.
10011002 Please, will you talk to him, when you can?
10011003 I'm sure he would be much contented.
10011100 Your seamster, Boc...
10011101 I see him crying, from time to time.
10011102 I think he misses his mother.
10011103 He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful.
10011104 Does being born of a mother...
10011105 Mean one behaves in such a manner?
10012000 ...
10012001 Is there...another person inside of you?
10012002 Did you...want that to happen?
10012003 I sense no malice. Do as you think best.
10012004 Hello, other you.
10012005 I am Melina, and I have an accord with this person.
10012006 We might be together for some time.
10012007 Pleased to meet you.
10012100 ...
10012101 Is there...another person inside of you?
10012102 Did you...want that to happen?
10012103 I sense no malice. Do as you think best.
10012104 Hello, other you.
10012105 I am Melina, and I am travelling with this person.
10012106 We might be together for some time.
10012107 Pleased to meet you.
10013000 The Erdtree...is close.
10013001 Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled.
10013002 It takes me back.
10013003 I was born at the foot of the Erdtree.
10013004 Where mother gave me my purpose.
10013005 Though now, everything is lost to me.
10013006 I...have to ascertain for myself.
10013007 The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless.
10013100 My utmost thanks.
10013101 For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree.
10013102 Here, I can govern my own movement.
10013103 And thus, the accord is fulfilled.
10013104 I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given.
10013105 Farewell.
10013106 I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you.
10013107 I wish you luck, in realising your ambition.
10013108 You have fought long and hard.
10013109 I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne.
10014000 Hello again, old friend.
10014001 Allow me a moment to converse with you.
10014002 You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no?
10014003 Prevented by the mantle of barbs.
10014004 The thorns are impenetrable.
10014005 A husk of the Erdtree's being, that spurns all that exists without.
10014006 The only way to stand before the Elden Ring...
10014007 and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns.
10014008 My purpose serves to aid in that very act.
10014009 So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me.
10014010 To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.
10014011 Then I can set the Erdtree aflame.
10014012 And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord.
10014100 I wish to journey with you once more.
10014101 To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.
10014102 Then I can set the Erdtree aflame.
10014103 And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord.
10015000 Think not, of the kindling.
10015001 I shall see to that.
10015002 All I ask of you is to make the journey.
10015003 To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds.
10015004 I know...
10015005 I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin.
10015006 But it must be done to reach the path beyond.
10015007 And that is the path I wish to travel.
10015008 What is your mind?
10016000 There is something I'd like to say.
10016001 My purpose was given to me by my mother.
10016002 But now, I act of my own volition.
10016003 I have set my heart upon the world that I would have.
10016004 Regardless of my mother's designs.
10016005 I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that.
10016006 Not even you.
10017000 We're almost there.
10017001 The flame of ruin lies just ahead.
10017002 I'm glad it was you I travelled with.
10017003 I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too.
10017004 Thank you, Torrent.
10017005 Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.
10017100 I have long observed the Lands Between.
10017101 This world is in dire need of repair...
10017102 and Death...indiscriminate...
10017103 Are you prepared...
10017104 To commit a cardinal sin?
10017200 Very well.
10017201 Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.
10017300 Very well.
10017301 Tell me, when you are fully prepared.
10017400 Are you ready to commit a cardinal sin?
10018000 If you intend to claim the frenzied flame,
10018001 I ask that you cease.
10018002 It is not to be meddled with.
10018003 It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending.
10018004 However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair...
10018005 Life endures. Births continue.
10018006 There is beauty in that, is there not?
10018007 If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion.
10018008 Please, leave the frenzied flame alone.
10018100 I shall see to the kindling.
10018101 It is a purpose which I choose to fulfil.
10018102 So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone.
10018200 The frenzied flame is not to be meddled with.
10018201 It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending.
10018202 So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone.
10018500 I ask you, one more time.
10018501 Please, seek not the frenzied flame.
10018502 As one who strives to become a Lord,
10018503 deny not the lives, the new births of this world.
10018504 Those who would are not fit to be called Lord.
10018505 When the land they preside over is lifeless.
10018600 Please, put a stop to this madness.
10018601 The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all.
10018602 When the land they preside over is lifeless.
10019000 You...have inherited the frenzied flame.
10019001 A pity. You are no longer fit.
10019002 Our accord ends here.
10019003 But remember...
10019004 Should you rise, as the Lord of Chaos,
10019005 I will kill you, as sure as night follows day.
10019006 Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes.
10019007 Goodbye, my companion.
10019008 Goodbye, Torrent...
10019100 You...have inherited the frenzied flame.
10019101 A pity. You are no longer fit.
10019102 Our journey together ends here.
10019103 And remember...
10019104 Should you rise as the Lord of Chaos,
10019105 I will kill you, as sure as night follows day.
10019106 Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes.
10019107 Goodbye, my companion.
10019108 Goodbye, Torrent...
10100100 You, please, I can read them.
10100101 Your fingers, please, your fingers...
10100200 Oh, bless you.
10100201 Oh..ohh!
10100202 Within the fog, a gaping hole. Beyond the fog, one cursed by blood.
10100203 Below the surface, traces of those who lurk in the shadows.
10100204 In the east, the east. Should you desire�
10100300 Oh, bless you.
10100301 Oh..ohh!
10100302 ...
10100303 Heavens, how can this be!
10100304 A dreadful sign! Truly dreadful!
10100305 You will face wrath, then madness, and finally, chaos.
10100306 Turn back.
10100307 This is a path you must forsake.
10100308 Dread awaits you in the south. Blackest dread!
10101000 Dragon slayer...
10101001 Ohhh, dragon slayer...
10101002 You unfeeling barbarian.
10101003 Planning to feast? On dragon?
10101004 At an abandoned church on that wee isle.
10101005 You would devour the heart of an ancient?
10101006 You wretched, undeserving brute!
10105000 Oh, bless you.
10105001 Oh..ohh!
10105002 Head to the foundation of gold, Tarnished...
10105003 Traverse Raya Lucaria, "Glintstone Eventide"�
10105004 �and reunite the half crescents, at the Grand Lift.
10105005 Oh, but the bridge is collapsed, and cannot be crossed.
10105006 Only, why should that matter!
10105007 Stormveil Castle still stands tall!
10106000 Oh, bless you.
10106001 Oh..ohh!
10106002 ...
10106003 Miquella's favour can be yours�
10106004 Slaughter, slaughter, slaughter... The all-hearing slaughtered, but alas, it was for naught.
10106005 But all you need do, is snatch it from the big pot.
10106006 ...
10106007 Pity the poor, poor fool!
10107000 Oh, bless you.
10107001 Oh..ohh!
10107002 ...
10107003 �Are you one for festivals? Or flowers?
10107004 To the South, a grand festival to make the stars turn.
10107005 To the East, the hardened bud of a flower to be.
10107006 But dare you enter?
10107007 Into the heart of the scarlet rot?
10107008 Ah...ahhh...
10108000 What a pity it is, to be without the right.
10108001 All you can do is stand, at a loss.
10108002 Without even the half crescents that wish to be whole.
10108003 Before the unmoving, unfeeling Grand Lift ahead.
10108004 ...
10108005 Or, are you planning to throw yourself to the waters?
10108006 To find the coward's passage, through the dim cavern?
10108100 Oh, bless you...
10108101 Bless you...
10108102 ...
10108103 You. The one who holds both half crescents.
10108104 Take the path to the Grand Lift ahead.
10108105 For you...are the one who will be Lord.
10108106 ...
10108107 Bear witness, one and all! The Lord is returned!
10108108 The Elden Lord is come again!
10109000 Oh, bless you...
10109001 Oh..ohh!
10109002 ...
10109003 To the east...ruins of gold. To the west...the serpent's sacrilege.
10109004 Wherever the path leads, so shall you follow.
10109005 Wherever the path leads, only more sorrow.
10109006 Tis a curse! A curse! The curse of Queen Marika!
10109007 Ah...ahh... Ha...ha...
10110000 The Fingers I served once prophesied...
10110001 A Tarnished would one day become Elden Lord and restore the Golden Order.
10110002 ...
10110003 Surely you see it, too?
10110004 The gold that enshrouds the heavens. The great tree which begets the pillars of light.
10110005 O Tarnished, hasten to the foot of the tree.
10110006 ...
10110007 And whatever you might face...
10110008 The Fingers will surely guide you...
10111000 Turn back.
10111001 Ahead lies the Land of the Giants' Flame.
10111002 And the way forth is forbidden.
10111003 ...
10111004 Hear me. The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin.
10111005 Doing so will unbind Destined Death, and slay the world itself.
10111006 ...
10111007 Who would dare put you up to such a task?
10111008 Most certainly not the Fingers!
10112000 Ohh...
10112001 Oh, Lord Godwyn...
10112002 Such cruelty, such humiliation...
10112003 My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.
10112004 As the first of the demigods to die.
10112005 As a martyr to Destined Death.
10112006 But why must it yet bring such disgrace?
10112007 A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death...
10112008 How could such a thing come to be...
10112009 <sobbing>
10112100 Ohh...
10112101 Oh, Lord Godwyn...
10112102 My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.
10112103 A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death...
10112104 How could such a thing come to be...
10112105 <sobbing>
10180000 Ha, ha, ha!
10180100 A curse! A curse upon you!
10180101 Your path leads only to death!
10180200 You godless brute.
10180201 You'll soil your hands soon enough.
10180202 With mortal sin!
10200100 Are you that new Tarnished?
10200101 You've done well. I am Enia, the Finger Reader.
10200102 I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will.
10200103 Look there. The Fingers tremble. To welcome you, shardbearer.
10200104 Let their wisdom wash over you.
10200105 "Great Elden Ring, root of the Golden Order."
10200106 "Anchor of all lands, giver of grace, wellspring of all joy."
10200107 "Until it was shattered."
10200108 "The tragic corruption of the Order has taken its toll."
10200109 "Across the realm, life lies in ruin. Fallen to pieces."
10200110 "Foul curses and misery spread, unabating."
10200111 "But the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it."
10200112 "So it is that the Tarnished are guided by grace. Called to act."
10200113 "Brave Tarnished, your Great Rune is a handsome shard of the Elden Ring."
10200114 "Seek another of its kind."
10200115 "To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."
10200116 Let the words of the Fingers guide you.
10200200 Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods,
10200201 the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring.
10200202 Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord.
10200203 And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished.
10200204 Listen, the Fingers speak.
10200205 "The Greater Will has long renounced the demigods."
10200206 "Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left."
10200207 ...Indeed. But remember one thing.
10200208 The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika.
10200209 Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation...
10200210 The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted.
10200300 Well, well� I see�
10200301 A remembrance of gold has found its way into your possession.
10200302 Demigods, and even the greater of the champions,
10200303 are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances.
10200304 They are�valuable indeed.
10200305 These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters.
10200306 And should you wish to wield that same power, well�
10200307 I will lend you the strength of the Fingers.
10200308 Heh� Do not recoil from my offer.
10200309 The Fingers guide us all. And you Tarnished, you are here to take, are you not?
10200400 Ah. You have returned. What is it?
10200500 Now, go forth.
10200501 Let the words of the Fingers guide you.
10201000 I had my doubts, but...my, look at you.
10201001 Only once before have I seen two Great Runes together.
10201002 Look there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance.
10201003 "Fine work, brave Tarnished. The Greater Will is pleased."
10201004 "You have earned the right to become Elden Lord."
10201005 "Now, seek the Erdtree, and an audience with Queen Marika."
10201006 "To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."
10201007 The Fingers expect...
10201008 As much from you as they do young Gideon.
10201009 Take this. A token of farewell.
10201100 Now, go forth.
10201101 Become Elden Lord.
10201200 Queen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision.
10201201 A god, in truth.
10201202 But after the Elden Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree.
10201203 A grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood.
10201204 The Fingers speak...
10201205 "Marika's trespass demanded a heavy sentence."
10201206 "But even in shackles, she remains a god, and the vision's vessel."
10201207 "Confer Great Runes to become Elden Lord, and join Queen Marika as her consort."
10201208 "The Fingers have willed it so."
10201209 Now, you may go.
10202000 Well, you managed to return.
10202001 You know what this means. The Erdtree has spurned you.
10202002 The Fingers remain still.
10202003 Shaken by this turn of events, they are busy consulting the Greater Will.
10202004 When they are finished, the Fingers will again offer their guidance.
10202005 But thousands, if not tens of thousands, of moons must first pass.
10202006 No matter for me. But you? How will you ever manage the wait...
10202007 My, oh, my...
10202100 It may be thousands upon thousands of moons before the fingers again offer their guidance.
10202101 My, oh, my. Whatever will you do�
10203000 Heavens forbid...
10203001 That is not the domain of mere men.
10203002 The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin. And you say you seek the power of the Rune of Death, too?
10203003 The Rune of Death goes by two names, the other is Destined Death.
10203004 The forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation�
10203005 Unleashing the rune now would be unthinkable...
10203006 The Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will.
10203007 ...
10203008 ...
10203009 But here we are...
10203010 The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will.
10203011 The realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers.
10203012 Who is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever?
10203013 Go on. Finish the job.
10203014 Take the course you deem most worthy.
10203100 You must find kindling.
10203101 Only the smoldering flame in the Great Forge of the Giants, on the highest peak in the Lands Between, can burn the Erdtree.
10203102 But special kindling is required to reignite the flame.
10203103 For the flame to burn the Erdtree, a sacrifice is needed. Of one who envisions the flame.
10203104 And can lead you to the Rune of Death.
10204000 You've done it, I see.
10204001 What use do you have for me, now?
10204002 I am a Finger Reader. I will remain here, until their dialogue ends, and the Fingers speak again.
10204003 Do as you please. Take whatever course seems most worthy to you.
10204004 Now, you may go.
10204100 Heh, heh, heh.
10204101 You'd force this tired old crone to work, even now?
10204102 A harder taskmaster have I never met.
10204200 Don't worry, my dear.
10204201 I'll see it to the end with you, if it please.
10204300 Now, go forth.
10204301 Do what you believe is right.
10600100 A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished.
10600101 I am the witch Renna.
10600102 I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed.
10600103 And upon looking into the matter,
10600104 the talk, I surmise, is of thee.
10600105 Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?
10600106 To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.
10600200 Ah. As I had hoped.
10600201 I was entrusted this, for thee.
10600202 By Torrent's former master.
10600210 Tis a bell for calling forth spirits.
10600211 Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree.
10600212 The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past.
10600213 Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest.
10600300 Forgive mine intrusion, Tarnished.
10600301 I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the Lands Between.
10600302 How long will it be, I wonder...
10600303 Before the Tarnished tire of obeisance to the Two Fingers?
10600310 ...
10600400 This way, Tarnished.
10600401 May I have a word?
10601000 Trifle not with me, Tarnished.
10601001 Or didst thou merely forget?
10601002 The name of the spectral steed thou callest?
10601100 I will ask thee again.
10601101 Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?
10601102 To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.
10601200 Quite the stubborn one, aren't we?
10601201 Wise, in a way. The Lands Between are home to liars and cheats aplenty.
10601202 Perhaps thine ample mistrust will be to thy benefit.
10601203 I shall leave this for thee, at the behest of Torrent's former master.
10601204 Take it, shouldst thou overcome thy suspicion.
10601210 ...
10602000 What hopest thou to profit?
10602010 ...
10602020 No sense in arguing, I see.
10602021 Thou'rt a wild one, indeed.
10602022 Torrent hath quite the ruffian chosen...
10602030 ...
10603000 Let us speak of the past, a while.
10603001 I was once an Empyrean.
10603002 Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.
10603003 Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age.
10603004 But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.
10603005 I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.
10603006 I would not be controlled by that thing.
10603007 The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since...
10603008 And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.
10610100 Oh, again we cross paths.
10610101 I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met.
10610102 It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty...
10610103 But Tarnished, what business hast thou here?
10610104 I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.
10610200 Mm? a Tarnished, here?
10610201 Thou must have some business in mind, to come all this way.
10610202 Though I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.
10611000 I see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we.
10611001 Indeed, I am the witch Ranni.
10611002 I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite.
10611003 I did it all.
10611004 But sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here.
10611005 I have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away.
10611006 And it is upon that flesh the cursemark is carved.
10611100 And why should I reveal that to thee?
10611101 I performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed,
10611102 but all the same, thy begging compels me not a jot.
10611103 The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.
10611104 Now, begone.
10611200 The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.
10611201 Now, begone.
10611300 Oh, is that so?
10611301 Thou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal?
10611302 Affording thyself opportunity to grope about for the cursemark's location, no doubt?
10611303 ...
10611304 Very well...
10611305 There's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme.
10611306 What's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee,
10611307 I am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends...
10611308 I'll allow it. Enter my service.
10611309 And good hunting to thee.
10612000 No reason in particular, thou claimest?
10612001 Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion.
10612002 ...
10612003 Wilt thou enter into my service?
10612004 I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path.
10612005 That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before.
10612006 Well? Has that roused thy interest?
10612050 No reason in particular, thou claimest?
10612051 Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this encounter.
10612052 ...
10612053 Wilt thou enter into my service?
10612054 I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path.
10612055 That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before.
10612056 Well? Has that roused thy interest?
10612100 I see. A choice well made.
10612101 Thou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer.
10612102 But I require as much of those under my command.
10612103 I anticipate good work from thee.
10612200 I see. More's the pity.
10612201 Come to me again, shouldst thou change thy heart.
10612202 Surrendering thyself into the service of a doll-witch...
10612203 Is not as frightful as thou fearest...
10612300 Ah, art thou persuaded to my cause?
10612301 Then, again I shall ask, wilt thou enter into my service?
10613000 Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.
10613001 There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd.
10613002 I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City.
10613003 I have called for Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars.
10613004 Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also.
10613005 Heed not their peculiarities, feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.
10613006 I am sure the others will be doing just the same.
10613010 Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.
10613011 There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd.
10613012 I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City.
10613100 Speak with the three who await thee below.
10613101 Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.
10613102 It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.
10613500 Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.
10613501 Art thou aware of the star that struck Limgrave?
10613502 It left a vast crater, and through it lieth the Eternal City of Nokron.
10613503 Go there to find the city's hidden treasure.
10613600 Ah, yes. Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, can be found below.
10613601 Like thee, they are in my service.
10613602 Heed not their peculiarities, feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.
10613603 I am sure the others will be doing just the same.
10613700 Speak with the three who await thee below.
10613701 Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.
10613702 It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.
10614000 Ah, allow me to forewarn thee.
10614001 I shall soon enter my slumber.
10614002 And it will be some time before I wake.
10614003 This doll's body is not without its hindrances...
10614004 Still, I have high hopes for thee.
10614005 I look forward to the good news when I arise.
10614100 I shall soon enter my slumber.
10614101 And it will be some time before I wake.
10614102 I have high hopes for thee.
10614103 I look forward to the good news when I arise.
10614500 ...
10617000 Ahh...It was thee.
10617001 Not Blaidd, it seemeth.
10617002 Even in my slumber, I sensed it.
10617003 It is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron?
10617004 My thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place.
10617005 Soon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.
10617100 Ah, but before I leave, I must entrust thee with this.
10617101 Take it.
10617110 My discarded flesh lieth beyond the seal unlocked by it.
10617111 Upon which is carved the cursemark of thy desire.
10617112 I can fathom what thy purpose might be.
10617113 Neither of us is welcomed by the brighter path, I see.
10617114 You may leave now.
10617115 It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.
10617200 What is it?
10617201 Thy purpose in approaching me was to obtain the cursemark, was it not?
10617202 You may leave now.
10617203 I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.
10617500 Ah, but before I leave, I shall entrust thee with this.
10617510 My thanks, for thy sterling efforts.
10617511 A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure.
10617512 I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion.
10617513 I must thank Torrent too, for his part.
10617514 You may leave now.
10617515 It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.
10617520 My thanks, for thy sterling efforts.
10617521 A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure.
10617522 I am certain now, fate steered us to our first encounter.
10617523 I must thank Torrent too, for his part.
10617524 You may leave now.
10617525 It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.
10617600 What is it? You may go.
10617601 I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.
10619000 ...
10619100 ...
10619200 ...
10619201 Oh? A dogged fellow, aren't we?
10619202 Or is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls?
10619203 Fine...fine.
10619204 I hadn't expected any soul to recognise me in this guise.
10619205 But now the cat is out the bag, I cannot allow thee thy freedoms.
10619206 Perform for me a service, as recompense.
10619207 Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.
10619208 The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.
10619209 I will not brook disobedience in this matter.
10619300 Perform for me a service, as recompense.
10619301 Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.
10619302 The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.
10619303 I will not brook disobedience in this matter.
10620000 Let us speak of the past, a while.
10620001 I was once an Empyrean.
10620002 Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.
10620003 Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age.
10620004 Which is when I received Blaidd. In the form of a vassal tailored for an Empyrean.
10620005 But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.
10620006 I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.
10620007 I would not be controlled by that thing.
10620008 The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since...
10620009 And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.
10620100 I turned my back on the Two Fingers and we have each been cursing the other since.
10620101 The Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.
10621000 Even when I turned my back upon the Two Fingers.
10621001 Blaidd remained my loyal ally.
10621002 Heh.
10621003 Though he was created a vassal for an Empyrean,
10621004 He was a colossal failure, on the part of the Two Fingers.
10621005 Blaidd, and Iji both... Art willing to give too much to me.
10621006 Yet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path...
10621007 That I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before.
10621008 Ah, should I add thee to the list?
10621009 Another one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they.
10621100 Ach, this form hath loosened my tongue.
10621101 I've let slip too much.
10621102 Forget what thou'st heard. Forget.
10622000 O Shadow, thou'rt the last.
10622001 Tell the Two Fingers,
10622002 That Ranni the Witch cometh, to rend thy flesh.
10622003 With a fateful wound, ne'er to heal.
10623000 Beautifully fought.
10623001 My thanks. 'Twas more of a challenge than I envisioned.
10623002 Now I can finally stand before them.
10623003 This is farewell, my dear.
10623004 Tell Blaidd, and Iji...
10623005 I love them.
10623050 Beautifully fought.
10623051 My thanks. 'Twas more of a challenge than I envisioned.
10623052 Now I can finally stand before them.
10623053 This is farewell, my dear.
10624000 So, it was thee, who would become my Lord.
10624001 Perhaps I needn't have warned thee.
10624002 I am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice.
10624003 I go now, to the night sky. It is there I shall find mine order.
10624004 I bid thee travel the path of the Lord.
10624005 And once all is done, we shall see each other, once more.
10625000 ...
10625001 I take it thou'st noticed? I shouldn't be surprised.
10625002 I thought I might expound a little further...
10625003 Upon the order I envision.
10625004 Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.
10625005 I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet.
10625006 As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at a great remove.
10625007 And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch...
10625008 All become impossibilities.
10625009 Which is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order.
10625010 Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord?
10625100 Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.
10625101 And I would abandon this soil, with mine Order.
10625102 Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord?
10626000 Well, this is a most unpleasant awakening.
10626001 The depths of wickedness never fail to surprise me.
10626002 I am saddened. That thou wouldst succumb to such depravity.
10626003 Led astray by Seluvis, with devious tonic in hand,
10626004 Didst thou think to have thy way with me?
10626005 Be gone. Hapless scum.
10626006 I won't have another whiff of thy rotten breath.
10626100 I have spoken. Away from my sight.
10626200 This is the third time, fiend.
10626201 Enough of thy unbearable breath.
10630000 What hopest thou to profit?
10630010 ...
10630020 To think such was thy plot.
10630021 Well, I refuse to indulge thy fantasies.
10630022 I relinquished a natural death long, long ago.
10630030 ...
10630100 What hopest thou to profit?
10630110 ...
10630120 Hmph.
10630121 So, this is the measure of my Lord?
10630122 Perhaps it is precisely what I deserve.
10630123 �For surrendering myself to delusion.
10630130 ...
11201000 ...
11201010 ...
11201020 ...
11201030 ...
11201040 ...
20000100 Come, sweetings, become what ye desire.
20000190 Come, sweetings, time to be born, anew.
20000200 Be not afeard, little culver.
20000400 Come, Oath-sworn giant!
20000410 Come, Oath-sworn dragon!
20000420 Come, Oath-sworn beasts!
20000430 Come, Blaidd, my child!
20000600 Thy fate lieth under my moon.
20000790 Oh little Ranni, my dear daughter.
20000791 Weave thy night into being...
20000900 Where did ye flee, my sweetings?
20000901 Come out, from whence ye hide. There are books and light aplenty.
20000902 Dither not, come out say I!
20000903 Or will ye be gravestones? To be better born anew?
20001000 Ah...thou...
20001001 Is it thy wish to be born anew?
20001002 To become a sweeting, reborn of my beloved egg?
20001100 Ah...thou...
20001101 Is it thy wish to yet again be born anew?
20001200 Now, bear this sweeting into life anew.
20001300 Be not alarmed, nor afeard.
20001301 I would birth thee as a sweeting, fair and fine.
20001400 Ah...thou...
20001401 Art thou now assured of thy want, to be born anew?
20001500 Ah, it seemeth thou'rt a sweeting rather fair.
20001501 And if thou wert born anew once more, thou wouldst be fairer still.
20001502 Ye will be countless born, forever.
20001600 Ah, thou'rt now a sweeting full fine and fair.
20001601 My thanks. For being born of my beloved egg, time and time again.
20003000 Where did ye flee, my sweetings?
20003001 Come out, from whence ye hide. Of the dark, be not afeard.
20003002 My beloved egg is with us. Come out, I prithee.
20200100 ...
20200200 ...
20200201 I smell it... Death...
20200202 Feed it me...
20200203 ...
20200204 Tarnished...bring more...Death...
20200205 I shall grant thee... eye...and claw.
20200206 Feed me...more.
20200300 ...
20200301 More... I am not...sated.
20200302 Feed me more...Death.
20200400 ...
20200401 My thanks...Tarnished...
20200402 Death... My sin... Should not be touched...by the hand of man...
20200403 I shall grant thee...my claws...
20200404 Feed me...more.
20200500 I shall grant thee... eye...and claw.
20200501 Feed me...more.
20200550 I shall grant thee... eye...and claw.
20200551 Feed me...more.
20200600 More... I am not...sated.
20200601 Feed me more...Death.
20200700 I shall grant thee...my claws...
20200701 Feed me...more.
20201000 <chewing>
20201001 It is... It is all...consumed.
20201002 Still, I am not sated... Not nearly sated...
20201003 Rrarrgh!
20201004 Marika... Is this...what it is...to sin?
20201005 Will things...never be the same...again?
20201006 ...
20201007 Tarnished...my thanks...for thy long...labour.
20201008 But I have done...all I can...in this land...
20201009 Henceforth, mine appetite shall be my sole companion.
20201010 Farewell.
20201050 <plaintive howl>
20201100 Tarnished...my thanks...for thy long...labour.
20201101 But I have done...all I can...in this land...
20201102 Henceforth, mine appetite shall be my sole companion.
20201103 Farewell.
20201150 <plaintive howl>
20202000 <pained howl>
20202050 <pained howl>
20203000 O Marika...
20203001 What...happened?
20203002 Was I...myself the fool?
20203003 Or was I tricked...by thee?
20203004 O Marika...
20203005 Why wouldst thou...relinquish...
20203006 Why...
20204000 ...
20204001 ...
20204002 ...
20205000 ...
20205001 Strange... There's something else...
20205002 But the Death...yet quenches...
20205003 Bring more...
20205100 <pained howl>
20205150 ...
20205151 <growl>
20205152 Put it away.
20205153 I won't forget...again...
20205154 mine appetite... My sin...
20205155 So please...enough...
20205200 <growl>
20205300 <chewing>
20205301 I won't forget...again...
20205302 mine appetite... My sin...
20205303 I must have more... I must consume more...
20206000 Thou, who approacheth Destined Death.
20206001 I will not have it stolen from me again.
20206100 Tarnished. Why wouldst thou...
20206101 Why...
20206110 Tis no matter. I hereby vow,
20206111 that Destined Death shall not be stolen again.
20280000 I shall not part with it again.
20280100 Stay away from Destined Death.
20280200 Cower. Before Maliketh, the Black Blade.
20280300 Cower. Before Maliketh, Marika's Black Blade.
20280400 Witless Tarnished... Why covet Destined Death?
20280401 To kill what?
20280490 Witless Tarnished... Why covet Destined Death?
20280491 To destroy what?
20280500 Forgive me, Marika...
20280501 The Golden Order...cannot be restored.
20281000 I must consume more...
20281100 Marika...why...
20281101 wouldst thou...gull me?
20281102 Why...shatter...
20390000 I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella.
20390100 Let your flesh be consumed.
20390101 By the scarlet rot.
20390400 Is this...my first...defeat?
20390401 Bravely fought, sir.
20390402 But remember...
20390403 One day, the scarlet bloom will flower again...
20390500 Your strength, extraordinary...
20390501 The mark...of a true Lord...
20390505 O, dear Miquella...
20390506 O, dearest Miquella, my brother...
20390507 I'm sorry. I finally met my match...
20400100 Well, thou art of passing skill.
20400110 Warrior blood must truly run in thy veins, Tarnished.
20400200 As I thought, thou'rt of passing valour...
20400201 but the dark of night is yet to lift.
20400202 The hands of the Fell Omen shall brook thee no quarter.
20400300 Foul Tarnished.
20400301 Put these foolish ambitions to rest.
20400302 The Erdtree is firmly rooted, always.
20400400 I'll remember thee, Tarnished.
20400401 The flame of ambition leadeth thee astray.
20400402 Come, hands of the Fell Omen. Snuff out this wretch's flame.
20400600 I see thee, little Tarnished.
20400610 Smould'ring with that wretched flame of ambition.
20400700 Hrghraah!
20400710 The thrones...stained by my curse...
20400711 Such shame I cannot bear.
20400712 Thy part in this shall not be forgiven.
20400800 Have it writ upon thy meagre grave:
20400801 Felled by King Morgott! Last of all kings.
20400900 May the curse seep to thy very soul.
20400901 An apt reward for thy brash ambition.
20401000 ...
20401100 <blank>
20401110 <blank>
20401120 <blank>
20480000 Well, thou art of passing skill.
20480001 Warrior blood must truly run in thy veins, Tarnished.
20480100 Put these foolish ambitions to rest.
20480200 I shall remember thee, Tarnished.
20480201 Smould'ring with thy meagre flame.
20480202 Cower in fear. Of the night.
20480203 The hands of the Fell Omen shall brook thee no quarter.
20482000 Hrghraah!
20482010 The thrones...stained by my curse...
20482011 Such shame I cannot bear.
20482012 Thy part in this shall not be forgiven.
20482100 Have it writ upon thy meagre grave:
20482101 Felled by King Morgott! Elden Lord!
20482200 May the curse seep to thy very soul.
20482300 ...
20482301 Tarnished, thou'rt but a fool.
20482302 The Erdtree wards off all who deign approach.
20482303 We are...we are all forsaken.
20482304 <blank>
20482310 None may claim the title of Elden Lord.
20482311 Thy deeds shall be met with failure, just as I.
20482312 <blank>
20680000 Tarnished Warrior. 'Twas nobly fought.
20680100 Dearest Marika...
20680101 I am returned.
20680200 A crown is warranted with strength!
20680300 O Marika!
20680301 I will take thee in mine arms once more!
20680400 Brave Tarnished...
20680401 Thy strength befits a crown.
20780000 Lowly Tarnished...
20780001 Thou'rt unfit even to graft...
20780100 Great Godfrey, didst thou witness?
20780200 ...I am the Lord of all that is Golden...
20780201 ...And one day, we'll return together...
20780202 ...To our home, bathed in rays of gold...
20780203 <blank>
20990000 tres
20990002 duo
20990004 unus
20990006 nihil
20990008 nihil
20990010 nihil
20990300 Miquella is mine and mine alone.
20990400 Now, surrender yourself.
20990401 To my blood, to our coming dynasty.
20990500 Ahh, I can see it, as clear as day!
20990501 The coming of our dynasty!
20990502 Mohgwyn!
20990600 Ahh, Miquella...
20990601 Why do you abandon me?
21300100 You're a new face.
21300101 No matter, it's all the same.
21300102 Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.
21300200 Back already?
21300201 No matter. Lay out your arms.
21300300 Back already? Can't get enough, eh.
21300301 No matter. Lay out your arms.
21301000 Well, where've you been hiding?
21301001 I took you for dead.
21301002 No matter. It's all the same.
21301003 Lay out your arms, then.
21302000 I see you've noticed the chains.
21302001 Nothing special. I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains.
21302002 I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools.
21302003 That's all there is to it.
21302100 Nah, don't read too much into it.
21302101 I've no grudge against you.
21302102 My being a prisoner is no fault of yours.
21302103 Besides, I don't mind smithing.
21302104 Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same. Given time, technique never fails.
21302105 Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her...
21303000 Now, look at you.
21303001 Those eyes tell a story.
21303002 Of a challenger, who's felled his mark.
21303003 Fine and well. Now, lay out your arms.
21304000 Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness.
21304001 The road is yet long. A god is not easily felled.
21304002 But one day, without fail, you will have your wish.
21304003 So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika...
21304100 Those words were not meant for you.
21304101 I may be prisoner to you Tarnished lot.
21304102 But my prayers are mine and mine alone.
21304103 Well, I've had my say. I'll be more careful, too.
21304200 Ah. You, is it?
21304201 I...didn't notice you there.
21304202 I'll be doing my job, same as ever.
21304203 Just lay out your arms.
21305000 The girl you brought here...
21305001 She's crestfallen, and can scarcely swing a blade,
21305002 but she has a gift for spirit tuning.
21305003 I saw another one like her, long ago.
21305004 Their eyes share the same hue.
21305100 The girl? What about her?
21305200 Are you out of your mind?
21305201 Who'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith?
21305202 Absurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it.
21305300 I refuse to believe it.
21305301 I don't doubt you, but I know when something's too good to be true.
21306000 I spoke with the girl.
21306001 She has a gift for spirit tuning.
21306002 So I told her everything I know.
21306003 I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago.
21306004 It was all I could do to honour her.
21306005 I'm sorry I doubted you.
21307000 The girl has come a long way.
21307001 As ever, time and technique have made her stronger.
21307002 Tis good to see.
21307003 An imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice, or a daughter.
21307004 But at times, that's precisely what she feels like to me.
21307005 I've gone soft. And it isn't easy.
21308000 No, no, no, no...
21308001 I need to do better than this! This'll never kill a god.
21308002 I can do better than this! It needs to slay a bloody god!
21308100 Oh, it's you.
21308101 Don't pay me any mind. It's not important.
21308102 Just lay out your arms.
21309000 Are you having second thoughts?
21309001 Might I have a word, then?
21309002 Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.
21309003 The demigods. And their god.
21309004 If you remain loyal to your calling,
21309005 then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,
21309006 I will never cease to smith your weapons.
21309007 Until you have one to slay a god.
21310000 I knew you'd be back.
21310001 Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.
21310100 Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.
21311000 Weren't you listening?
21311001 As I've always said.
21311002 You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them.
21311003 And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons.
21311004 It is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god.
21311100 I've upset the girl.
21311101 She says that now that my chains are broken, I'm free.
21311102 That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable.
21311103 <blank>
21311104 What use have I for freedom now?
21311105 I smith weapons to slay a god.
21311106 I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot.
21311107 Is there any other way?
21312000 Oh, finally! It's complete!
21312001 I've done it! A weapon to slay a god!
21312002 Oh, you have my deepest gratitude.
21312003 Thanks to you, my wish is granted.
21312004 Now wield it, and kill them.
21312005 The demigods. And their god.
21312006 Queen Marika herself wishes it so.
21312100 You seek better weapons still?
21312101 Very well. I'll smith another, if needed.
21312102 A weapon to slay a god.
21312200 I'll smith as long as you like.
21312201 Now, lay out your arms.
21312300 I'll smith...as long as you like.
21312301 Now...lay out your...arms.
21312400 I'll smith...as long...as you like.
21312401 Now...lay out...your...arms.
21313000 Use my masterpiece to slay a god.
21313001 That is all that I have lived for.
21313002 And my promise to Q-queen Marika.
21313003 But do me a favor, and do look after the girl.
21313100 I can't hold on much longer.
21313101 I'm going the way of the R-roundtable...
21313102 It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here.
21313103 Allow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends.
21313104 My lord, f-for that is what you are.
21314000 Who are you?
21314001 Oh, I must be a blacksmith.
21314002 Now, let's get smithing...
21314100 Could you tell me what happened?
21314101 Why is the Roundtable burning, in ruins?
21314102 Why does that girl weep for me?
21314103 Have I forgotten something of dire importance?
21315000 Now, let's get smithing...
21316000 ...
21316001 I-I smith... I do...
21490000 A fine sacrifice indeed.
21490001 Let us devour the gods, together!
21490090 Now you are family.
21490091 Let us devour the gods, together!
21490100 Now, we can devour the gods, together!
21490200 O shapers of gods, meddlers in fortune.
21490201 I do not abide! By your suffocating Order.
21490400 So must it be.
21490401 Eveligne, show him the way...
21490402 ...to devour the gods.
21490500 No one will hold me captive.
21490501 A serpent never dies.
21490502 Ha ha ha...
21600100 <howl>
21600200 Who goes there?
21600201 Kal� send you, did he? Ever the bloody busybody.
21600202 Hmm. Maybe to him, you don't seem so strange.
21600203 The name's Blaidd. I'm looking for a man who goes by "Darriwil".
21600204 He fled somewhere nearby. Or so I've heard.
21600205 Come tell me if you find him before I do.
21600206 I can offer you ample reward.
21600300 Darriwil is nothing but a traitor.
21600301 And in need of a fitting end to his tale.
21601000 Darriwil...
21601001 Rotting in a cell is no true justice.
21601002 No, this is where it ends for you.
21602000 ...Right. There you are.
21602001 Had to work for it, but it's done.
21602002 Don't say I'm not a man of my word. Here's your prize.
21602100 Oh yes, I should say,
21602101 If you venture north to Raya Lucaria, and come across a venerable blacksmith who's a little on the large side...
21602102 Tell him I sent you.
21602103 And he'll be sure to treat you right.
21602104 I owe you one, I reckon.
21602200 That's enough chit-chat for now.
21602201 It's time we parted ways.
21603000 Ahh, long time, friend.
21603001 Blaidd, if you've forgotten.
21603002 Glad to have you in the service of mistress Ranni.
21603003 Well. Getting right to business...
21603004 I'm still in Limgrave.
21603005 The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land.
21603006 I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood.
21603007 See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...
21603100 Ah. I heard about you. Good to finally meet.
21603101 Name's Blaidd, sworn sword to mistress Ranni.
21603102 Glad to have you aboard.
21603103 Well. Getting right to business...
21603104 I'm situated in Limgrave right now.
21603105 The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land.
21603106 I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood.
21603107 See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...
21603200 I'm going below through the well in the Mistwood.
21603201 See if I can't find the road to Nokron...
21603202 Don't keep me waiting, eh.
21604000 Ah, good to see you.
21604001 Apologies mate, but I don't have much to report.
21604002 I can see bloody Nokron, right above me, but I'm absolutely stumped.
21604003 I've tried all the gateways, to no avail...
21604004 ...Perhaps it's time to ask Seluvis?
21604005 I recall that spiteful little rat acting like he knew something...
21604006 Let's give him a squeeze. Show him just how sharp my teeth are...
21604100 I jest, I wouldn't go that far.
21604101 Besides, I should check on some things here.
21604102 Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.
21604103 If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?
21604200 Ah. Well met.
21604201 What news?
21604300 Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.
21604301 If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?
21604302 And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source.
21604303 Seluvis rarely gives a straight answer, the first time.
21605000 Hmm...
21605001 So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn...
21605002 That reminds me of something I heard.
21605003 There's a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wilds, east of Limgrave.
21605004 It's a festival of combat. And I heard...that you can fight Radahn himself. He who was once called the strongest of all the demigods...
21605005 Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I think it's worth investigating.
21605006 I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then...
21605100 You're coming too, right? To Radahn's festivities...
21605101 I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid.
21605102 The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.
21605200 Right. I see.
21605201 Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.
21605202 If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?
21605300 Hmm...
21605301 So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn...
21605302 And there's a festival of war being held at Redmane Castle in Caelid,
21605303 where you can fight the man himself, once the strongest of the demigods.
21605304 It's all coming together. Seems like Iji was on to something.
21605305 I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then...
21606000 Ah, there you are. Took your sweet time.
21606001 The players are all made up, and waiting for the curtain...
21606002 Let's give them a show to remember, eh.
21606003 Just don't you go dying on me. For Ranni's sake, too.
21606100 Once more into the fray together, eh.
21606101 Heh. This might even be fun.
21606200 Into the fray together, eh.
21606201 Heh. Let's see what you're made of.
21606300 Ah, thought I might find you here.
21606301 I must admit I was a little worried. We missed our meeting.
21606302 But it looks like you're still in one piece, eh.
21606303 You must have heard by now, right?
21606304 That Starscourge Radahn holds Ranni's fate in stasis.
21606305 But once he's out of the way, it will spring back into motion.
21606306 So now, we stand against the demigod once known as the strongest of them all.
21606307 The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.
21606400 Hm. Long time.
21606401 Seems we're fated to keep crossing paths.
21606402 Now, we find ourselves at a festival of combat, pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods.
21606403 The way ahead is pleasingly simple. A path forged by sword and fang.
21606500 Mm... As a fellow combatant, allow me to introduce myself.
21606501 Blaidd, warrior.
21606502 Now, we find ourselves pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods.
21606503 The way ahead is pleasingly simple, a path forged by sword and fang.
21606600 Hm. Nothing to do but wait. Until the festival begins.
21608000 Ah, good. I was waiting for you.
21608001 What a sick way to fight, eh.
21608002 The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you.
21608003 And hah! Did you see that, afterwards?
21608004 A falling star, right before our eyes!
21608005 I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale.
21608006 He was a living legend, if ever I saw one.
21608007 And, the path has now been cleared.
21608008 To Nokron, where Ranni's fate will be decided.
21608009 Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth.
21608010 We'll take up our swords once more. For mistress Ranni.
21608100 Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth.
21608101 And we'll go into battle again, side by side.
21608102 My only purpose is to fight for Ranni's fate, sword and fang.
21608103 The curtain's rising...on the final act.
21608200 Hmph, what a sick way to fight, eh mate.
21608201 The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you.
21608202 And then a falling star, right before our eyes!
21608203 I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale.
21608204 He was a living legend, if ever I saw one.
21608300 Well, it's time I left.
21608301 The wheel of fate has been set into motion.
21608302 If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again.
21608303 You are a fine warrior.
21608400 If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again.
21608401 You are a fine warrior.
21609000 <howl>
21610000 Oh, it's you...
21610001 It's me, Blaidd.
21610002 Old Iji trapped me here.
21610003 Told me I'd bring nought but bale to Lady Ranni.
21610004 But there's no chance that could happen.
21610005 I'm part of her being. Her very shadow...
21610006 I thought old Iji knew as much...
21610007 Honestly, I don't know what's going on anymore...
21610100 I don't understand. Why would Iji do this...
21610101 I could never intend harm to Lady Ranni. What's he thinking...
21611000 My thanks, friend.
21611001 I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now.
21611002 I don't know what came over old Iji,
21611003 but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe.
21611004 Now, Ranni can finally set in motion
21611005 the fight against her fate she's dreamt of for so long.
21611100 I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now.
21611101 I don't know what came over old Iji,
21611102 but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe.
21612000 ...
21612001 No. I'm part of her very being!
21612002 I could never betray her!
21612003 No matter what might happen...
21612004 Ranni... She needs me...
21612100 <growling>
21680000 Oh?
21680100 What are you playing at?
21680200 Fine.
21680201 Time to douse your little flame.
21680300 Alright then.
21680301 Better to put you down now.
21680302 Before you trouble mistress Ranni.
21680400 Hmph. Pathetic little man.
21680500 Don't show your face again.
21680501 Stay away from mistress Ranni.
21680600 You're...you're strong of arm.
21680601 But ask yourself...
21680602 What harm can be done...to a shadow?
21680700 Traitorous wretch...
21680701 You're...you're a danger...
21680800 Stop, please...
21680810 You think me a bringer of bale as well?
21680820 Fine. I am Ranni's shadow and it's for her that I fight.
21680821 Whatever any of you might call me.
21680900 I am no bringer of bale.
21680901 I must return to Ranni's side.
21681000 Tell...me...
21681001 Why... Why am I...bale to Ranni?
21681100 Didn't I say? No harm can befall a shadow.
21681200 I...am shadowbound.
21681201 Wherever mistress Ranni goes, I follow.
21681202 You are a danger. You die here.
21681300 Rraargh!
21800100 Please, wait!
21800101 Proud Tarnished warrior. Before you kill me, let me speak.
21800102 I can aid you. Please, just hear me out.
21800200 Thank you for listening.
21800201 I am Asimi. My true form is that of a silver tear.
21800202 I am a simple being who can assume the shapes of other living things.
21800203 But now, I've gained knowledge. I speak, and ponder, and...live in fear of death.
21800204 O, mighty Tarnished warrior, I beg of you.
21800205 Let me keep the life I've been granted. In exchange, I offer you power.
21800300 Ahh, thank you.
21800301 Now, set your lips upon me, and breathe in deep.
21800302 I will live inside of you, and grant you strength untold.
21800400 Onward, to our glorious future, my host...
21800500 You won't listen to me, will you?
21800501 It's such a pity. I had a feeling you would become...
21800600 Please, proud Tarnished warrior, I beg you reconsider.
21800601 The gifts I can bestow you in life far outstrip those which could be plundered from my corpse.
21800602 Please, can't you find it in your heart to trust me?
21800700 So, you won't trust me.
21800701 But you still haven't killed me, have you.
21800702 Do you wish to think it over? Then I will wait.
21800703 For as long as it takes for you to trust me.
21800800 Proud Tarnished Warrior, have you made up your mind?
21800801 I can grant you power, if you let me live.
21801000 My lord host, do you hear that?
21801001 The sound of water. The river that flows in my home, the Eternal City.
21801002 Good lord host, I beg you, we must see the Eternal City.
21801003 To discover the ancient wonders of the stars. A wellspring of strength.
21802000 My lord host, great lord host.
21802001 May I ask something of you?
21802002 A chalice is close by, the cradle of my kind...
21802003 Would you mind finding it for me?
21802004 Mm, you should find the chalice...and drink it dry.
21802005 Ahh, my lord host. I am terribly parched.
21802006 The chalice will quench my thirst, rejuvenate my flesh, and allow me to grant you further strength.
21802007 Please, my lord host. It is my only desire.
21802100 Bless this brook of sustenance. My lord host...
21803000 My lord host, great lord host.
21803001 A tear chalice lies in these lands, too.
21803002 A tear chalice lies in these lands.
21803003 Our mother chalice.
21803004 Please, search out this most sacred chalice.
21803005 It's suffused with the blessed wonders of the stars...
21804000 Now, lord host.
21804001 Please, drink every last drop from the mother chalice.
21804002 So that we may form a perfect whole.
21804100 Oh no...
21804101 Excuse me, lord host.
21804102 I'm still so very, very parched.
21804103 In the other Eternal City, there's a cradle chalice to be found.
21804104 And if you were to drink the entirety of that one, first...
21805000 Ahh, are you awake?
21805001 We've become a perfect whole.
21805002 There is nothing to fear. I will merely follow in your footsteps.
21805003 Living only as you would have yourself.
21805004 And I vow, that when I perfect your form.
21806000 Ahh, how could you...
21806001 I was you, and only you. We were one...together.
21806002 Please, I only want to live...
21806003 I only wanted you...
21806004 to become Lord...
21806005 Gah...
21807000 Oh...you found me...
21807001 I had hoped you wouldn't...
21807002 You could have become Elden Lord, and I could have become Sovereign Eternal, eventually.
21807003 If you hadn't found me, we both could have been Lords.
21880000 I was wrong about you...
21880100 My apologies, lord host.
21880101 I will take the throne.
21880200 I'm...dying...
21880201 So this...is fear...
21880300 I'm...glad...
21880301 My lord host, worthiest of lords...
21900100 Ah!
21900101 Please, no. Dear me!
21900102 ...
21900103 I haven't a clue.
21900104 No secrets lie with me, not a one.
21900105 Oh, please. Leave me be.
21900200 Wait, then, you're not one of them?
21900201 Well, what a relief.
21900202 ...
21900203 Oh, goodness me.
21900204 I am Albus. An Albinauric, as you can see.
21900205 We're finished. The whole village is finished.
21900206 The cursemongers have destroyed everything. No one that remains has their wits about them.
21900207 I beg you. Would you look after this medallion?
21900208 You must keep it out of the cursemongers' hands.
21900210 And if you should meet the young Albinauric Latenna,
21900211 then please, give it to her.
21900300 A chosen land awaits us Albinaurics.
21900301 The medallion is the key that leads to the city.
21900302 It's only a quaint treasure, for we who cannot make the journey.
21900303 But for dear Latenna, it is needed. To fulfil her purpose.
21900400 My legs will soon fade, and with them, my life.
21900401 Alas, this is the immovable fate of all Albinaurics.
21900402 ...
21900403 ...
21980000 Ngh!
21980100 We are Albinaurics.
21980101 We have caused you no harm!
21980200 You merciless brutes.
21980201 Let the curse take everything.
21980300 I will never give this up.
21980301 Not to your kind.
22000100 Hello-o? Can you hear me?
22000101 Help me! I'm stuck!
22000102 Hello? Hellooo! Anyone?
22000200 Oh my stars I'm so happy to see you!
22000201 I am Alexander, also known as the Iron Fist. And as you can see, I'm stuck here.
22000202 Please, can you help me out of this?
22000230 My thanks! A thousand thanks!
22000231 Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big.
22000232 And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure!
22000233 Don't dally. No no, there's no need to fret, I'm very well trained.
22000234 Give it your all, I say!
22000300 Ah!
22000310 Ouuch!
22000400 S-stop please! That's a little too rough for me, friend.
22000401 You'll crack me in half, like that! A little more gently, gently, please.
22000500 Ahhh!
22000600 Ahh! Well played, good sir. Well played!
22000601 Though that mighty wallop of yours almost spelt the end of me!
22000602 Ha ha ha ha!
22000603 Well, I'm out now, and that's what counts.
22000604 I thank you, and as a token of my appreciation, I'd like you to have this.
22000700 Once again, the pleasure is mine. I am the warrior jar known as Alexander. Iron Fist Alexander, in fact.
22000701 I journey to the east, where I intend to further my education in the ways of war.
22000702 Beyond these lands lie the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
22000703 And upon their southern edge is Redmane Castle, in which a festival of combat is being held.
22000704 I'd heard whispers of such festivities before...
22000705 Doesn't the notion set your breast aflutter!
22000706 Ha ha ha ha!
22000800 I see. More's the pity.
22000801 No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing.
22000802 Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait.
22000900 Ah, what's that look, good sir?
22000901 Are you willing to help me out after all?
22001000 Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.
22001001 I'll pop clean out. I'm sure, of it!
22001100 Don't stop now, friend.
22001101 Just keeping clobbering away at the old behind!
22001102 Put those doubts to rest, I'll be just fine. I'm very well trained.
22001103 Give it your all, I say!
22001200 G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my face!
22001201 Smack me from the other end! The other end!
22001300 I'm heading eastward.
22001301 To Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
22001302 I've heard there's to be a festival held there.
22001400 G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my lid!
22002000 Oh, I hadn't expected to see your face again.
22002001 Are you heading to the festival of combat, too?
22002002 Oh, no need to be coy with me.
22002003 Judging by the fine wallop you gave the old backside earlier, I would venture you're something of a warrior yourself.
22002004 The mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!
22002005 Now, now, according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.
22002006 But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.
22002007 I'm sorry to have raised your hopes.
22002008 It seems my calculations must have been off...
22002100 I was created to be a warrior vessel.
22002101 Many great warriors reside within me, ever dreaming of becoming a great champion.
22002102 It's my destiny. And the reason for which I quest.
22002103 It is my ordeal, you could say. To test myself, to better myself, to fell ever greater foes.
22002104 And then, one day, we'll be a single great champion. The greatest of them all!
22002105 What do you think, eh? How do you rate my chances?
22002106 Heh heh...
22002200 Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior.
22002201 Are you travelling my way?
22002202 I'm heading to the festival at Redmane Castle, on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
22002203 Oh, no need to be coy with me.
22002204 I can tell from your bearing you're skilled in the arts of combat.
22002205 Ah, yes, the mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!
22002206 I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander.
22002207 And according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.
22002208 But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.
22003000 ...!
22003001 Good sir, where did you spring from?
22003002 This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.
22003003 What's going on here? A door, from thin air!
22003004 Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds.
22003005 I suppose my calculations were right all along. You should head this way as well, friend.
22003006 Heh heh...
22003100 ...!
22003101 The esteemed warrior. Where did you spring from?
22003102 This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.
22003103 What's going on here? A door, from thin air!
22003104 Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds.
22003105 Gosh, that dead-end had me rather stumped!
22003106 Heh heh...
22003200 ...!
22003201 Where did you spring from?
22003202 This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.
22003203 What's going on here? A door, from thin air!
22003204 Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward I shall go.
22003205 I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander.
22003206 I was heading to Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
22003207 Where a festival is being held. Until I was stumped by that dead end!
22003208 Heh heh...
22003300 It's time I set off.
22003301 To the festival at Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.
22003302 Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter!
22004000 Ah, you came, how delightful!
22004001 Indeed, I thought I might find you here.
22004002 By the by, do you know for whom this festival is being held?
22004003 Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!
22004004 To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...
22004005 In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute.
22004006 But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!
22004007 Now, be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.
22004008 I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.
22004100 Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior.
22004101 I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander. The pleasure is mine.
22004102 Do you know for whom this festival is being held?
22004103 Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!
22004104 To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...
22004105 In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute.
22004106 But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!
22004107 Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.
22004108 I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.
22004200 Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.
22004201 I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.
22005000 A-ah, hello there.
22005001 It was a battle marvellously fought. You are well and truly a champion, friend.
22005002 I, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock.
22005003 One hit was all it took to crack me, and for my insides to come spilling out...
22005004 After that, I hid like a coward.
22005005 And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you.
22005100 ...But don't you think I've given up just yet.
22005101 As luck would have it, there's a veritable mountain of warriors' bodies right here.
22005102 If I can just squeeze this bunch down inside me, I'll be a mighty warrior again in no time.
22005103 And you know... The bodies found here are exceedingly fine.
22005104 Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!
22005105 Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger!
22005106 Just you wait, when next we meet!
22005107 Heh heh...
22005200 Alright lads, I'm going to take you on a little journey.
22005201 You'll all be inside me, and be part of me.
22005202 From now on, we're all in it together.
22005203 So let's all of us dream big.
22005300 The bodies found here are exceedingly fine.
22005301 Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!
22005302 Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger!
22005303 Just you wait, when next we meet!
22005304 Heh heh...
22006000 Hello-o? Can you hear me?
22006001 Help me! I'm stuck!
22006002 Hello? Hellooo! Anyone?
22006100 Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face!
22006101 As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in another hole.
22006102 Would you mind helping me out, again?
22006113 My thanks in advance, I know you're the man for the job!
22006114 You know what to do, hm?
22006115 Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.
22006116 Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival.
22006117 I'm stuck back together good and proper!
22006118 Just give it your all!
22006200 Ah!
22006210 Ouuch!
22006300 P-please! Wait. I have a terrible feeling about this!
22006301 Would you stop hitting me for a minute!
22006400 I see. More's the pity.
22006401 No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing.
22006402 Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait.
22006500 What's that look, good sir?
22006501 Are you willing to help me out after all?
22006600 Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big!
22006700 I can feel my lower half is stuck on something.
22006701 I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time.
22006702 Hmm...
22006703 Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...
22006704 What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?
22006800 Hmm...
22006801 Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...
22006802 What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?
22006900 Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face!
22006901 As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in a hole.
22006902 Would you mind helping me out?
22007000 Ngh!
22007010 Nngh!
22007011 Oh, yes!
22007012 That's the ticket!
22007100 Nnngh!
22007200 My thanks! To you and your razor-sharp wits.
22007201 As a token of my thanks, I'd like you to have this.
22007300 Deary me, I'm oilier than a toad!
22007301 There were countless oil jars back where I'm from, actually.
22007302 And now I know what it's like to be one of them!
22007303 Heh heh...
22007400 Yes, indeed, I too have a home.
22007401 Though it is one to which I have vowed not to return.
22007402 So, I thought I might look out from atop the cliff, but as I drew closer and closer...
22007403 Pow! Wouldn't you know it, I was perfectly stuck in that blasted hole.
22007404 I can feel the warriors inside admonishing me for my mawkishness.
22007405 To walk the path of champions, one cannot cleave to the past!
22007406 I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north.
22007407 I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel.
22007408 I will forge myself anew in its flames!
22007500 I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north.
22007501 I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel.
22007502 I will forge myself anew in its flames!
22008000 Ngh!
22008001 Rnnngh!
22008002 O mountain of fire! Bake me in your flames!
22008003 Rrrrngh!
22008100 Nnngh!
22008101 Ah, good sir, what business might you have in such a place as this?
22008102 I hardly think you're here to temper yourself with flame, considering that fleshly form of yours.
22008103 Your timing though, is impeccable as ever!
22008104 I've been making just the thing for you on my journey here.
22008105 Take it, I'm sure it'll suit you to a tee.
22008110 But oh, it's hardly more than lukewarm here.
22008111 I won't be able to temper my body such that it'll never crack again.
22008112 Perhaps I'll head eastward.
22008113 There's an old saying I've caught wind of.
22008114 "Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars."
22008300 Perhaps I'll head eastward.
22008301 There's an old saying I've caught wind of.
22008302 "Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars."
22009000 Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself.
22009001 The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves.
22009002 But that aside, you're certainly a force to be reckoned with, eh.
22009003 I doubt there's a single soul who could've handled that giant, other than you. It was practically a god...
22009004 Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many.
22009005 Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you.
22009006 Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?
22009007 Come and tell me when you're ready.
22009008 I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.
22009100 You are ready then, I take it?
22009105 Then let us begin!
22009106 I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander!
22009107 Lend me strength, O warriors within!
22009108 Let us become one champion, together!
22009110 I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander!
22009111 Lend me strength, O warriors within!
22009112 Let us become one champion, together!
22009200 Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself.
22009201 The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves.
22009202 But that aside, I can't believe you felled that giant. It was practically a god...
22009203 I doubt there's another soul out there who could've done the same.
22009204 Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many.
22009205 Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you.
22009206 Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?
22009207 Come and tell me when you're ready.
22009208 I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.
22010000 As I suspected... Victory...was impossible.
22010001 This vessel...was found lacking...
22010100 My thanks. I knew you were the stuff of champions.
22010101 It was a marvellous battle.
22010102 I implore you, take what I bequeath...from inside me...
22010103 All vessels are destined to one day break.
22010104 But the great Alexander lived as a warrior to his last!
22010105 Ha ha ha ha!
22010200 Good sir, I can't believe your heart was in it at all.
22013000 By the gods you are a man of vision!
22013001 This will have me as slippery as a toad.
22013002 I have a good feeling about this, my friend.
22013003 Right! Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big!
22013100 Argh! Cease! Please!
22013101 Just stop a moment, I beg!
22013200 My lower half is stuck on something down there!
22013300 I'll break! I'll break before I'm out!
22013400 Argh! No!
22013401 Stop, please!
22013402 I beg! I beg of you!
22013500 Argh!
22014000 Phew.
22014001 I thought I was apt to split in half...
22014002 Mm, I can feel my lower half is stuck on something.
22014003 I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time.
22014004 Hmm...
22014005 Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...
22014006 W-what if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?
22014100 My thanks! A thousand thanks!
22014101 Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big.
22014102 And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure!
22014103 Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival.
22014104 I'm stuck back together good and proper!
22014105 Just give it your all!
22080000 Ngh!
22080100 What are you playing at?
22080101 This is no time for games!
22080200 Wait, I see. I see it now.
22080201 Humans all lose their wits, eventually.
22080300 Then there's nothing left to say, except...
22080301 I am Iron Fist Alexander!
22080302 The great jar warrior!
22081000 A finer battle was never witnessed.
22081001 How do you fancy joining the lads inside, eh?
22082000 How could this...
22082001 Was my whole existence... just a crock?
22090000 <blank>
22090001 <blank>
22090002 <blank>
22100100 ...
22100110 ...
22100120 ...
22300100 Oi! You there!
22300101 Could you help us out, cully?
22300103 You, yeah, you there!
22300104 Stop pretending you can't see me!
22300106 Why won't anyone look me in the eye?
22300107 I-I'm not that ugly, am I?
22300200 Ow!
22300201 What'd you go and do that for!
22300300 Hm? Oh, yes, I remember.
22300301 Some clod turned me into a tree.
22300302 You were just breaking the spell, weren't you.
22300303 Thank you. The name's Boc.
22300304 I was pushed out of the cave. Told not to come back, not ever.
22300305 Then I ended up as a tree.
22300306 Lucky you came along, really.
22300400 Oh, what a shame.
22300401 When they threw me out of the cave, they took everything I owned,
22300402 and so this is all I have to express my thanks.
22300403 I hope you can forgive me.
22300405 Or, if you can afford to wait for a while,
22300406 I could sneak back into the cave, and bring back something of actual value.
22300407 Then I'd be of some real use to you, I reckon.
22300500 Right, but I'll need a moment.
22300501 I-I'm frightened of them... So I have to gather myself.
22300502 My knees start knockin'...just thinking about that god-awful cave on the shore...
22301000 Oh, what are you doing here?
22301001 You must leave this place at once. They'll rush in and beat you to a pulp.
22301002 You'll end up just like me.
22301100 Wait, is that what I think it is?
22301101 You got it back for me? My sewing needle!
22301103 <sob>
22301104 What made you go and do a thing like that...
22301105 My mum was a seamstress...
22301106 ...and that sewing kit was all I had to remember her by.
22301107 I always wanted to be just like sweet old Mum.
22301108 Then, I suppose I-I can't just curl up and die, can I.
22301200 Thank you.
22301201 You're very kind.
22301202 I always wanted to be a seamster, l-like my mum.
22301203 Then, I suppose I can't just curl up and die, can I.
22301300 Oh..
22301301 It...hurts...
22301302 Ooh...
22302000 Good to see you! Master.
22302001 Do you remember me? Boc, the demi-human.
22302002 You helped me before, and retrieved my sewing needle.
22302003 Please, master.
22302004 Allow me to serve you, as your seamster.
22302005 I can't make nothing from scratch, but�
22302006 I'm happy to make adjustments to your garments.
22302100 Boc the seamster, at your service, Master.
22302101 Ready to make adjustments to your garments.
22302200 Oh, going so soon?
22302201 Please, do be safe on your journeys.
22302300 Master, I was wondering...
22302301 Do you ever...make adjustments to your garb yourself?
22302302 I would, well, rather you let me do the job when possible, please.
22302303 I don't ask anything in return, you know, and, well...
22302304 I am your personal seamster, after all!
22303000 Master, my apologies.
22303001 Your wardrobe includes the garb of old demigods,
22303002 and I'm afraid I can't make adjustments to them.
22303003 My mum told me once.
22303004 That a royal seamster would do them up in a jiffy.
22303005 Just wait, master. Before long, I'll be that good, too!
22303100 Is that a gift for my undeserving self?
22303101 Thank you kindly. But what on earth could it...
22303102 Oh!
22303103 Amazing! I've never seen a golden needle, not in all my life!
22303104 With a spectacular royal crest, to boot...
22303105 Are you certain that this is for me?
22303106 Oh, I can hardly believe it.
22303107 Have faith in me, Master!
22303108 I'll polish my craft enough that I deserve this golden gift!
22303109 I'll be the golden seamster, Boc!
22303110 Now I'll be able to sew anything, even the threads of the demigods!
22303200 Do you think that Mum would be pleased if she knew?
22303201 That I'm as good as any royal seamster, now.
22303202 Oh, it's still not enough.
22303203 I need to learn how to sew from scratch, like her.
22304000 Master, may I ask you something?
22304001 Would you mind if I called you lord?
22304002 I heard that you and the other Tarnished seek the throne of the Elden Lord.
22304003 Well, I know that you will be the one,
22304004 and you'd make just the manner of kind-hearted lord that I'd wish for.
22304005 So, please, if you would.
22304006 Allow me to call you lord.
22304100 You don't say! Thank you, thank you!
22304101 M'lord, m'lord, m'lord!
22304102 Please, become Elden Lord.
22304103 And please, let I, Boc the seamster, remain at your side.
22304200 No, and why would you...
22304201 Forgive me, for overstepping my bounds. I didn't mean it.
22304300 Boc the seamster, at your service, m'lord.
22304301 Ready to make adjustments to your garments.
22304400 Going already, m'lord?
22304401 Please, do be safe on your journeys.
22304500 Master, did you see it?
22304501 Th-the Erdtree?
22304502 I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...
22304503 But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast.
22304504 The Erdtree is waiting for you, master.
22304505 I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones.
22304600 M'lord, did you see it?
22304601 Th-the Erdtree?
22304602 I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...
22304603 But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast.
22304604 The Erdtree is waiting for you, m'lord.
22304605 I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones.
22304606 O please, take the throne of Elden Lord.
22305000 M'lord... Have you ever wished you might be born again?
22305001 Well, they say that Rennala of Raya Lucaria
22305002 has the power to help people be reborn.
22305003 Oh? Me? Reborn?
22305004 Oh, look at me. When you're this ugly...
22305005 well, being reborn? It would hardly make a difference, I'm afraid.
22305100 M'lord, what's this?
22305101 Oh! Oh!
22305102 It can't be� For my rebirth?
22305103 But these are precious, are you certain that it's for me?
22305104 Oh...
22305105 M'lord, how did you know?
22305106 It was my only wish, that I might honour you with a decent appearance.
22305200 M'lord, it shouldn't take me long.
22305201 I'm off to see Rennala of Raya Lucaria.
22305202 I'll be reborn, fresh and new.
22305300 M'lord.
22305301 In all honesty, what do you think of me?
22305302 Am I fit to serve a lord such as you, in all my ugliness?
22305303 Must I be reborn, no matter what ill fate awaits me?
22305304 Oh, I'm such a fool.
22305305 I don't even have answers to the simplest of questions.
22305400 Master... Have you ever wished you might be born again?
22305401 Well, they say that Rennala of Raya Lucaria
22305402 has the power to help people be reborn.
22305403 Oh? Me? Reborn?
22305404 Oh, look at me. When you're this ugly...
22305405 well, being reborn? It would hardly make a difference, I'm afraid.
22305500 Master, what's this?
22305501 Oh! Oh!
22305502 It can't be� For my rebirth?
22305503 But these are precious, are you certain that it's for me?
22305504 Oh...
22305505 Master, how did you know?
22305600 Master, it shouldn't take me long.
22305601 I'm off to see Rennala of Raya Lucaria.
22305602 I'll be reborn, fresh and new.
22305700 Master.
22305701 In all honesty, what do you think of me?
22305702 Am I fit to serve you, master, in all my ugliness?
22305703 Must I be reborn, no matter what ill fate awaits me?
22305704 Oh, I'm such a fool.
22305705 I don't even have answers to the simplest of questions.
22306000 Did I just hear my mum speaking?
22306001 Thank you very much.
22306002 Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.
22306003 And now, my dear lord let me hear her voice.
22306004 Please, if I may dream, just once...
22306005 Do you feel the same way my mum did, m'lord?
22306006 Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?
22306100 <sob>
22306101 M'lord, my dear lord...
22306102 I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service.
22306103 May the throne of Elden Lord be yours.
22306200 No, why on earth would you...
22306201 It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did.
22306202 But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance.
22306203 One day, I'll look every bit the servant.
22306500 Did I just hear my mum speaking?
22306501 Thank you very much.
22306502 Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.
22306503 And now, my kind master let me hear her voice.
22306504 Please, if I may dream, just once...
22306505 Do you feel the same way my mum did, master?
22306506 Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?
22306600 <sob>
22306601 Master, kind master...
22306602 I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service.
22306700 No, why on earth would you...
22306701 It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did.
22306702 But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance.
22306703 One day, I'll look every bit the servant.
22311000 ...
22380000 Ow!
22380002 Why'd you go and do that?
22380003 It's because I'm ugly, isn't it?
22380100 Oh, now, you too, is it?
22380101 The story of my rotten life...
22380102 Ah...aaah!
22380200 No...
22380201 I never wanted this...
22380300 Mum...
22380301 I've... I've let you down...
22381000 Ow!
22381001 M-master?
22381002 Is something wrong?
22381003 It's me! Boc, the seamster!
22381100 Master, what's happened...
22381101 Did I do something wrong?
22381102 Or is it just...because I'm ugly?
22381200 Oh, my...
22381201 Master, is that the truth, your heart of hearts? My, oh my...
22381202 Ah...aaah!
22381300 Oh, master, what have I done...
22381301 Master! Master!
22381400 Master...
22381401 I've failed you...please, forgive me.
22382000 Ow!
22382001 M-m'lord?
22382002 Is something wrong?
22382003 It's me! Boc, the seamster!
22382100 M'lord, what's happened...
22382101 Did I do something wrong?
22382102 Or is it just...because I'm ugly?
22382200 Oh, my...
22382201 M'lord, is that the truth, your heart of hearts? My, oh my...
22382202 Ah...aaah!
22382300 M'lord, what have I done...
22382301 M'lord! M'lord!
22382400 M'lord...
22382401 I've failed you...please, forgive me.
22400100 Well, look at you. We don't receive many visitors.
22400101 I presume you are a Tarnished. What brings you here?
22401000 Oh, pardon me. It's hardly my place to ask, is it.
22401001 I am Iji. A blacksmith who once served the Carian royals�
22401002 An old codger who refuses to retire his rusty hammer.
22401003 So, here I am, still quietly plying my trade, on this spot.
22401004 Perhaps you'd like a display? These bones are old, but still able.
22401100 Well, it's kind of you to speak to me again.
22401101 Then I presume these old bones served their purpose, more or less?
22401200 Brave Tarnished. Here to put my old bones to work again?
22401300 Brave Tarnished. A word of warning, if you please.
22401301 This territory once belonged to the Carian royal family. Their manor lies not far beyond this point.
22401302 When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract.
22401303 After leveling it, they carried on to the manor.
22401304 The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught...
22401305 By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day.
22401306 That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manor.
22401307 Unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless Knights of the Cuckoo.
22401400 Oh, watch out, there.
22401401 When I'm absorbed in my smithing, I lose sight of all else.
22401402 If you come too close, I'm apt to cause you harm.
22401403 I am, after all, terribly large compared to you, Tarnished.
22401404 You don't know how hard it is not to break anything while I work.
22401500 Something else for you?
22401600 I've explained the peril.
22401601 Of the enchanted snare that remains at the royal Carian Manor.
22401602 Whatever you do, brave Tarnished, stay away from that deathtrap.
22401700 Blaidd actually did that, did he?
22401701 Quite a rare occurrence, for such a guarded soul as he.
22401702 Perhaps he sensed something unusual about you.
22401703 At any rate, if you're friendly with Blaidd,
22401704 I've something else that might suit you.
22402000 Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.
22402001 Again, I am Iji.
22402002 The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.
22402003 I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.
22402004 I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success.
22402400 Oh, then you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.
22402401 The pleasure is mine. I am Iji.
22402402 The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.
22402403 I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.
22402404 I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success.
22403000 I take it you've heard of the Eternal City of Nokstella?
22403001 Well, it has a twin, known as Nokron. The other Eternal City.
22403002 After years of expeditions, we've determined the location of Nokron.
22403003 By going underground through the well in the Mistwood of Limgrave, you can see Nokron up above.
22403004 Only, we've failed to find a path leading to the city.
22403005 Blaidd's made a good go of it, but I'm afraid this has him quite stumped.
22403006 To be honest, I'm not sure where to go from here...
22403100 Blaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother.
22403101 Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood.
22403102 They were always happy to have me tag along, as well.
22403103 When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean,
22403104 Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals,
22403105 but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together.
22403106 Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you?
22403107 The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you.
22403200 Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.
22403201 Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.
22403202 An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.
22403203 No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival.
22403204 Oh, no, wait...
22403205 How did I not see it before!
22403206 I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight!
22403207 Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars.
22403208 As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line.
22403209 But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars.
22403210 Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory.
22403211 And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.
22403212 As would Lady Ranni's destiny.
22403213 Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron.
22403250 Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.
22403251 Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.
22403252 An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.
22403253 No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival.
22403300 My apologies for the misleading words of warning.
22403301 I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate.
22403302 I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not.
22403303 Do forgive me, my fellow.
22403304 Let us give all that we can of ourselves.
22403305 Together, for Lady Ranni.
22403400 Let us give all that we can of ourselves.
22403401 Together, for Lady Ranni.
22403500 Let us give all that we can of ourselves.
22403501 Together, for Lady Ranni.
22403600 Well, my fellow. How may I serve you?
22403601 As war counsellor, or as blacksmith?
22403700 Greetings, my fellow. How can I help?
22403800 Something else for you?
22403900 Go with Blaidd to the festival grounds.
22403901 Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.
22403902 Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron.
22404000 Ah, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything.
22404001 You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.
22404002 The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all.
22404003 There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgement of character.
22404004 Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.
22404005 Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.
22404006 And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.
22404100 Oh, Blaidd wanted me to tell you.
22404101 Not to bother waiting for him, and head straight to Nokron.
22404102 Blaidd has been given an important task.
22404103 Apparently, a matter of great urgency.
22404200 You need not await Blaidd.
22404201 Descend underground alone where the fallen star struck Limgrave.
22404202 And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.
22404203 So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean.
22405000 Now the festival is over, and General Radahn is defeated...
22405001 Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled.
22405002 Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role.
22405003 Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made.
22405004 With the stars of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality...
22405005 Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed...
22405100 Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.
22405101 Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.
22405102 An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.
22405103 It's funny how things happen.
22405104 Jerren and I parted ways long, long ago, yet here he is, playing his part in Lady Ranni's fate.
22405105 I'm afraid I never saw it coming. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...
22406000 I presume you've spoken with Blaidd?
22406001 Very well. There is something you should know.
22406002 The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery.
22406003 But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, resists being an instrument of the Two Fingers,
22406004 the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse.
22406005 But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight.
22406006 It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake.
22407000 Unthinkable, how could Blaidd...
22407001 How did he break free from his cell?
22407002 No, more importantly...
22407003 Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni, yet even in madness, gave himself to her.
22407004 I've made a grave misjudgment. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...
22407005 I'll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd.
22407006 When I do, I only hope you'll accept my apology.
22410000 Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.
22410001 You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.
22410002 A grand reward, justly procured by any measure.
22410003 Again, I am Iji.
22410004 The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.
22410005 I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni.
22410100 Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.
22410101 Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.
22410102 And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.
22410103 So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean.
22410200 Oh, so you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.
22410201 You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.
22410202 A grand reward, justly procured by any measure.
22410203 The pleasure is mine. I am Iji.
22410204 The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.
22410205 I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni.
22415000 Oh, there you are. Good of you to drop by.
22415001 Have you heard? Lady Ranni has departed on her journey.
22415002 Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna's Rise, as she calls it.
22415003 It would not have been possible without you.
22415004 As Lady Ranni's war counsellor, and moreover, her childhood warden, I express my deepest gratitude.
22415005 You, and only you, were Lady Ranni's true champion.
22415100 My purpose is nearing its end.
22415101 I've served Lady Ranni for as long as I can remember...
22415102 It has been a long and wondrous journey.
22415103 Now Lady Ranni is in your hands.
22415104 I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end.
22415200 Well, what's this?
22415201 Are you certain? This is a fine reserve.
22415202 Perhaps you knew that Old Iji appreciates a good drink.
22415203 I'll save it for a quiet moment, that I might truly savour it.
22415300 Lady Ranni has departed on her journey.
22415301 Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna's Rise, as she calls it.
22415302 Now Lady Ranni is in your hands.
22415303 I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end.
22480000 Ngh!
22480100 Enough of that, Tarnished.
22480101 There is no fight without a foe.
22480200 If that's the cloth you're cut from,
22480201 Don't ever show your face again.
22480202 Not to me. And not to my liege.
22480210 ...
22481000 Agh.
22481100 Cease this treachery at once.
22481101 Lady Ranni will be devastated.
22481200 This is a true shame.
22481201 Don't ever show your face again.
22481202 Not to me. And not to my liege.
22481210 ...
22600100 Hallo coz, what are you doing here?
22600101 I didn't think anyone knew about this place, 'cept us jars.
22600102 Oh! Are you going to be the new Potentate?
22600200 Gosh, truly? That's wonderful news!
22600201 It's not easy being Potentate, though.
22600202 I know, show me your hands.
22600203 It's just a little test, coz, to see if you've got the right stuff.
22600300 Hmm.
22600301 Your skin isn't so smooth, is it...
22600302 You need slick, slidey hands to be Potentate, you know.
22600303 I'm sorry coz, but I don't think you've got what it takes...
22600304 What a shame...
22600400 Oh, hallo again, coz.
22600401 I'm happy you came back.
22600402 I have good tidings for you, coz.
22600403 Have you noticed the rare flowers growing in this village?
22600404 I asked the villagers if you could pick some of them.
22600405 And they said you'd be very welcome!
22600500 You know the huge vase, at the centre of our village?
22600501 If you plant lovely flower seeds inside the big vase, coz...
22600502 Those flowers will bloom all through the whole village!
22600600 Oh, well, I'm sorry.
22600700 Coz. You'll be our Potentate after all, then?
22600800 Don't look so glum, coz.
22600801 We can still chat, Potentate or not.
22600802 Come back and visit me, when you can.
22600900 Go on, coz, you really should pick some of our flowers.
22600901 Go on, coz, you really should pick some of our flowers.
22601000 Oh, did you come to visit me again, coz?
22601001 I'm happy you came back.
22601002 Can you tell me about the outside?
22601003 Oh first though, if you have some nice flower seeds,
22601004 can you put them in the big vase in the middle of the village?
22601005 I'm sure, when lots of them are in bloom,
22601006 everyone will be so happy.
22601100 Oh, hallo again, coz.
22601101 I'm happy you came back.
22601102 Can you tell me about the outside?
22601103 Oh, and you put seeds in the big vase, didn't you?
22601104 Thanks, coz.
22601105 I'm so excited to see what kind of flowers will blossom...
22602000 Oh, hallo again, coz.
22602001 You put seeds in the big vase, didn't you?
22602002 Such pretty flowers are blooming! Everyone's so happy.
22602003 I've never seen anything like it! I'd love to see more flowers from the outside, someday. Loads more!
22602100 Oh, hallo again, coz.
22602101 You put seeds in the big vase, didn't you?
22602102 But...I don't really like those flowers.
22602103 I'm sorry coz, I know you brought the seeds from all that way away...
22602104 But I'm a jar, and you're not. I s'pose we just see things differently.
22603000 Ah, hallo again.
22603001 Say, coz. Have you met Uncle Alexander?
22603002 He used to live here with us, but then he left, to be a champion.
22603003 I asked to go with him, but he said "The path of champions must be trod alone".
22603004 So heroic, right? I miss him though.
22603005 If you see him, you should ask him to teach you how to fight, coz.
22603006 He's big and tough and strong!
22603100 Uncle Alexander said he won't be back again.
22603101 "My home is of the past. And the past, as they say, is a different country."
22603102 I suppose that's part of being a warrior, isn't it.
22603103 So...please don't tell anyone, coz, but...
22603104 I'm actually a warrior jar as well! One day, I'll be just like Uncle Alexander.
22603105 And I'll have to leave the village to become a champion.
22603200 Uncle Alexander won't come back here again.
22603201 "My home is of the past. And the past, as they say, is a different country."
22603202 I suppose that's part of being a warrior, isn't it.
22604000 Ah, hallo again.
22604001 Do you know what a poacher is, coz?
22604002 They hunt us, smash us, and then take us away.
22604003 This village is kept secret, so I think we're safe here.
22604004 But you should be careful if you ever meet one of them, coz.
22604005 I hope uncle Alexander beats them all up, first...
22604100 Those awful poachers. I hope uncle Alexander beats them all up.
22605000 Oh, hallo again, coz.
22605001 Have you heard? A new Potentate's come to the village!
22605002 I think he said his name was Diallos.
22605003 He seems a little down in the dumps, but his hands! As smooth as silk!
22605100 I don't know, I'm a little disappointed actually.
22605101 Even though good sir Diallos has a wonderful suit of armour...
22605102 He says he isn't a warrior.
22605103 And since he's a coward, he won't be fighting anymore.
22605104 His smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us.
22605105 But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you.
22605200 Diallos' smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us...
22605201 But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you.
22606000 O-oh! Coz!
22606001 I'm glad you came.
22606002 But we're fine now. Diallos fought the poacher.
22606003 Though quite a lot of us got broken...
22606004 ...
22606005 I won't cry though... I'm a warrior jar. A warrior.
22606100 "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."
22606101 That's the kind of warrior I want to be one day, coz.
22606102 Even if I'm scared, I'll still fight to protect everyone.
22606200 "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."
22606201 That's the kind of warrior I'm going to be.
22606202 One who protects everybody.
22607000 Thanks for coming back, coz.
22607001 I've been thinking. It's time for me to set out on a journey.
22607002 As a warrior jar, upon the path of champions.
22607100 Wow, coz, are these...
22607101 Insides?
22607102 From Uncle Alexander?
22607103 ...
22607104 Thank you, coz.
22607105 I'm a warrior jar, so I need to be strong.
22607106 I can really have them, right?
22607107 I understand. I'll get strong.
22607108 Strong enough I deserve to have Uncle's insides.
22607200 I'm about to go on a journey.
22607201 As a warrior jar, in search of glory.
22607300 Oh, hallo again, coz.
22607301 No, I haven't changed my mind.
22607302 I'll begin my journey once I'm ready to go.
22607303 As a warrior jar, in search of glory.
22607400 I'll begin my journey once I'm ready to go.
22607401 As a warrior jar, in search of glory.
22608000 I don't think I'll see you again, when I set out.
22608001 Warriors are supposed to work alone.
22608002 Goodbye, coz.
22608003 And thanks for everything.
22608004 I'll never forget you, coz.
22608100 I'll never forget you, coz.
22680000 Oh?
22680100 What's the matter, coz?
22680101 What's the matter, coz?
22680200 Is this who you are, coz?
22680201 You've cracked my heart.
22680202 Please, don't crack the others...
22680300 You were a poacher, all along.
22680301 You've cracked my heart.
22680302 Please, don't crack the others...
22680400 So, you were a poacher, too.
22680401 But the tale of house Hoslow is told in blood.
22680402 I'll find you, one day, coz...
22700100 Sister... Where did you go?
22700102 You promised me. When we turned 14, we'd go to see the stars...
22700104 I've been waiting ever so long. Forever and ever, it seems.
22700200 Ahh, dear sister, you're finally here.
22700201 No time to waste. Let's see the stars.
22800100 Foul Tarnished, what do you want?
22800101 I told the all-hearing brute.
22800102 That I possess no such medallion.
22800103 Or have you come to take more from me?
22800104 Was my other half not enough?
22800200 I told the all-hearing brute already.
22800201 That I possess no such medallion.
22800202 Or have you come to take more from me?
22800203 Was my other half not enough?
22801000 Oh...do you speak true?
22801001 So old Albus entrusted his medallion to you.
22801002 ...
22801003 Then I've no choice. But to trust that this was his dying will.
22801004 Let's try again. I'm Latenna. An Albinauric, the same as Old Albus.
22801005 My apologies for my coarse words earlier.
22801006 I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like that all-hearing brute.
22801007 I hope that you will forgive me.
22801100 Mm, the medallion is better off in your hands, anyway.
22801101 Would you consider doing me a great service?
22801102 I must go back.
22801103 There is something that I must do, even if I must say farewell to my wolf, Lobo.
22801104 Will you show me the way? To the land of Miquella's Haligtree.
22801105 If you accept, I would gladly apprise you.
22801106 Of the whereabouts of the medallion's other half.
22801200 Thank you kindly.
22801201 They say the other half of the medallion is beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.
22801202 In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.
22801300 Then I suppose it's time.
22801301 Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half.
22801302 I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain.
22801303 Forgive me, Lobo.
22801400 Call upon me when needed.
22801401 And I will fight at your side.
22801500 Well...
22801501 I understand. You must have your own duty to fulfil.
22801502 But please, allow me to say my piece.
22801503 Even if you cannot take me, old Albus wished I relay to you the following:
22801504 The other half of the medallion can be found beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.
22801505 In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.
22801600 If you seek the other half of the medallion, they say it's beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.
22801601 In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.
22801700 My thanks...
22801701 You'll lead me then, to the land of Miquella's Haligtree.
22801702 Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half.
22801703 I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain.
22801704 Forgive me, Lobo.
22801800 Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna.
22801801 We're almost there. Castle Sol lies just off to the north,
22801802 where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree.
22801900 Castle Sol lies just off to the north,
22801901 where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree.
22802000 Oh young yet towering sister of ours.
22802001 Let the birthing droplet in.
22802002 And create life. For us. For all the Albinaurics.
22802100 Thank you.
22802101 I've finally fulfilled my purpose.
22802105 Our young yet towering sister will give us hope.
22802106 Now that nothing is left unfinished,
22802107 I will join you in battle to the bitter end.
22802108 And when the fighting is done,
22802109 then you may lay me to rest. Beside Lobo, my dear wolf.
22803000 Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna.
22803001 We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree, where Lobo and I began our travels.
22803002 It's entirely thanks to you that I'm so close to home.
22803003 These great snow-laden lands stretch far to the north.
22803004 And beyond the ancient bowers, and the liturgical town of Ordina,
22803005 lies the place to which I must return.
22803100 We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree.
22803101 These great snow-laden lands stretch far to the north.
22803102 And beyond the ancient bowers, and the liturgical town of Ordina,
22803103 lies the place to which I must return.
22880000 Ngh!
22880100 Stop, now.
22880101 And I'll consider that a simple mishap.
22880200 Are all you Tarnished the same?
22880201 Was taking my other half not enough for you?
22880300 There is no meaning in a fight, lest it serve a greater duty.
22880400 Ohh...Phillia
22880401 Take...the birthing...droplet...
30000100 Brave Tarnished, welcome to the Volcano Manor.
30000101 I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house.
30000102 Rya spoke well of you.
30000103 "A warrior of promise," I believe she said.
30000104 Perhaps you are prepared to make a commitment.
30000105 Will you join us here at the Volcano Manor, and resist the tide?
30000106 Why accept the burden of their grace, or be fooled by the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers?
30000107 Rise with us, against the Erdtree.
30000200 Interesting. Your decision is most welcome.
30000201 Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.
30000202 The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.
30000203 But be sure to earn your keep.
30000300 Well. That is unfortunate.
30000301 Rya will be disappointed, but I won't twist your arm.
30000302 Now, time for you to leave, I should think.
30000303 Let this intersection of our paths be the last.
30000400 Aren't you precocious.
30000401 We rarely receive visitors to the Volcano Manor without invitation.
30000402 Fascinating. And not unlike another guest we had long ago�
30000403 So, Tarnished, have you ever harboured doubts?
30000404 About the burden of grace, and the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers?
30000405 If you have, why not join the Volcano Manor, and fight with us?
30000406 Rise with us, against the Erdtree.
30000500 Your decision is most welcome.
30000501 Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.
30000502 The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.
30000503 I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. An honour to have you.
30000600 Well. That is unfortunate.
30000601 Now, time for you to leave, I should think.
30000602 Let this intersection of our paths be the last.
30000700 Did you read the letter left for you?
30000701 That is the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.
30000702 You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck.
30000703 If you are loath to hunt your own kin, so be it.
30000704 But you must leave this house at once.
30000705 This is a war against the Erdtree.
30000706 We have no place for the meek, nor the luxury of keeping clean hands.
30000800 What's this?
30000801 Have you reconsidered the prospect?
30000802 Of rising with us, against the Erdtree?
30000900 Very well.
30000901 Your decision is most welcome.
30000902 Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.
30000903 The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.
30001000 You've completed your task.
30001001 I am pleased. Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.
30001002 This is your reward, as promised.
30001005 Never forget. That the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion.
30001006 The way is tainted, but for this very reason,
30001007 it is the true path to valour.
30001200 I see you've performed another task for us.
30001201 Here is your usual reward. Please, take it.
30001205 Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you.
30001206 Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard.
30001207 The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace.
30001208 But it was all too meagre, in the face of the enormity of their task.
30001209 The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs.
30001210 Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering.
30001211 Our Lord, indignant, has refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us.
30001212 If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so,
30001213 then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy.
30001214 We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done.
30001215 If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.
30001216 The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle.
30001217 It cannot come a day too soon!
30001300 The letter describes the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.
30001301 You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck.
30001400 If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.
30001401 It cannot come a day too soon!
30002100 She said that, to you?
30002101 I should have known something was wrong. The signs were clear enough.
30002102 Well. Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you.
30002103 That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage.
30002104 Think about it. We are resisting the ways of the Erdtree itself.
30002105 What matters one's lineage in such a crisis?
30002200 No, I haven't seen Zorayas anywhere.
30002201 And she has no scouting duties now.
30002202 Has she gone off in search of answers?
30002203 Why won't she just listen...
30002300 May I ask your aid?
30002301 Not as the Manor's proprietress, but as Zorayas' mother.
30002302 If she discovers the answer to her question, and it causes distress,
30002303 have her drink this potion.
30002304 To purge that which would cause her pain.
30002400 Yes, I know.
30002401 My wish is a grave disrespect to her.
30002402 No different than the Erdtree's imposition.
30002403 But I've no choice... It must be done.
30002500 Thank you, for allowing me this.
30002501 I will never be a good mother. My heart is too frail.
30002502 Our Lord must have known this all along.
30002503 My meekness is all too clear...
30002600 Really, she is dead, then...
30002601 My gratitude for your forthrightness.
30002602 If you would...allow me some time alone.
30002900 Please, allow me some time alone.
30003000 I see that you've stayed the path of champions.
30003001 This is your usual reward. Please, take it.
30003005 Perhaps you are ready. Might you see our Lord?
30003006 Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.
30003100 Yes, as it should be.
30003101 Now, close your eyes for a moment.
30003102 I will transport you to the Lord's chamber.
30003200 I see... Well, I cannot make you take the leap.
30003201 But do know this.
30003202 To follow the path of valour, an audience with our Lord is essential.
30003203 In order to defy this debasement, and rise up against the Erdtree.
30003204 Like a true recusant of the Volcano Manor.
30003300 Won't you consider having an audience with our Lord?
30003301 Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.
30004000 You...
30004001 It's true then. You've defeated our Lord.
30004002 No, I must thank you. Our Lord was yet weak. You have taught us that.
30004003 Defeat is not the end. Our Lord is immortal, and will one day rise again, stronger.
30004004 Until then, I must stay the path, and do my part.
30004100 I will leave the Volcano Manor before long.
30004101 I suggest you do the same.
30004102 I will miss these encounters.
30004103 The champion who walks the tainted path shines all the more.
30004104 I always was an admirer.
30005000 Oh, you...
30005001 Allow me some time.
30005002 Our Lord's carcass is vast, and not easily consumed.
30005003 Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me,
30005004 I wish to be your serpent, your family.
30005005 One day, let us devour the gods together.
30005100 Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me,
30005101 I wish to be your serpent, your family.
30005102 One day, let us devour the gods together.
30007600 Now, time for you to leave, I should think.
30007601 Let this intersection of our paths be the last.
30007700 The drawing room is through the hall.
30007701 Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable.
30008200 Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.
30008201 I am pleased to have you on our side.
30011000 Did you see her?
30011001 The girl, Rya�with her true face.
30011002 ...
30011003 Well, if she confided in you the name Zorayas,
30011004 then perhaps it is not my place to speak.
30011005 But as her adoptive mother, I ask of you.
30011006 Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas.
30011007 Her true visage belies the purity of her heart.
30011008 �Honestly, I hardly deserve the sweet child.
30011100 Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas.
30011101 Her true visage belies the purity of her heart.
30011200 Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you.
30011201 That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage.
30011300 My wish is a grave disrespect to her.
30011301 But I've no choice... It must be done.
30011400 Sweet Zorayas, have I earned your scorn?
30020000 This is farewell.
30020001 Perhaps we will meet again, along the path.
30020100 What is it?
30020101 I have no need of that.
30020102 I must continue devouring my beloved lord...
30020200 Oh, you...
30020201 Allow me some time.
30020202 Our lord's carcass is not easily consumed.
30080000 <blank>
30080001 <blank>
30080200 Ahh, my lord...
30080201 Rykard...
30100100 Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we?
30100101 Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?
30100102 Of course you have. No shame in it.
30100103 But I'm afraid you're plumb out of luck.
30100104 You are maidenless. A bit player, fully divorced from the strength of runes.
30100105 Feel free to go off and die in a ditch somewhere.
30100200 Oh, can't seem to wrap your head around your predicament?
30100201 It's no surprise. You poor have-nots are a stubborn lot.
30100202 Fine, then.
30100203 If you must have a go at it, maidenless as you are, you'll require an education.
30100204 On the ways of the learned Tarnished.
30100205 Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.
30100206 You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.
30100207 That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel.
30100208 It's nothing short of a miracle. That the guidance of grace can lead you,
30100209 maidenless as you are, to the perfect place to die in obscurity.
30100300 What's the matter?
30100301 Shouldn't you be off proving yourself, or some such?
30100302 Then go on, take the hint and follow the guidance of grace.
30100303 To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff.
30100304 And if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle,
30100305 you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold�
30100400 Guidance will show the way, most certainly.
30100401 To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.
30100402 The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.
30100403 Although I'm afraid you'll never make it that far, hmm.
30100404 Rest assured, I sympathise, deeply. There's no worse fate than to be maidenless.
30100405 Oh, but if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle,
30100406 you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold�
30101100 Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we?
30101101 Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?
30101102 Of course you have. No shame in it.
30101103 Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless.
30101104 Without guidance, without the strength of runes, and without an invitation to the Roundtable Hold...
30101105 You are fated, it seems, to die in obscurity.
30101200 Luckily for you, however, there is one shining ray of hope for even the maidenless.
30101201 Me. Varr�. Take care to listen.
30101202 Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.
30101203 You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.
30101204 That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel.
30101205 Mm, indeed. Grace's guidance holds the answers.
30101206 It will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow.
30101207 Even if it leads you to your grave.
30101300 Grace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly.
30101301 To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.
30101302 The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.
30101400 It's time you set off, I should think.
30101401 To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you.
30101402 If you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are.
30102000 Ohh, well done, well done indeed.
30102001 You made it through that entire mess, all the way to Stormveil.
30102002 And off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold� My sincerest congratulations.
30102003 But, how did you find the Roundtable?
30102004 Oh, you don't have to say it.
30102005 Before, the Roundtable was chock full of venerated warriors, but now, it's home to puff-chests and has-beens.
30102006 I fear you've been terribly disappointed.
30102007 I don't blame you. But still, the Roundtable has its perks.
30102008 Why not earn a seat? Fly straight and true, so to speak.
30102100 Ahh, then you're interested? A wise choice indeed.
30102101 To join the Roundtable proper, you must acquire a Great Rune, and request audience...
30102102 ...with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.
30102103 They are the purported masters of the grace that guides your kind, the Tarnished.
30102104 Mm, yes, pay them a visit, so that you may see for yourself.
30102200 Challenge Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, to acquire a Great Rune.
30102201 Decrepit, he may be, but a demigod he remains. And of course, an inheritor of a Great Rune.
30102202 Worse yet, I hear old Godrick's acquired a ferocious new toy to graft...
30102203 So. Prepare for the worst.
30102300 ...
30102301 Yes, I see. Perhaps it's just as well.
30102302 Besides, you are maidenless. One can only do so much with the materials provided.
30102303 But then again, if you should realise the error of your ways,
30102304 I'm always willing to hear you out.
30102400 Oh, have you decided to have a go after all? At joining the Roundtable proper?
30102500 What's the matter?
30102501 Aren't you supposed to be earning your place at the Roundtable Hold?
30102502 Then you must face Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil,
30102503 for without a Great Rune, you will not be granted audience.
30102504 With the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.
30102600 Ohh, well done, well done indeed.
30102601 You bested Godrick the Grafted, and claimed a Great Rune.
30102602 My congratulations.
30102603 Now, visit the Roundtable Hold.
30102604 For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.
30102610 Ohh, well done, well done indeed.
30102611 You felled a demigod, and claimed a Great Rune.
30102612 My congratulations.
30102613 Now, visit the Roundtable Hold.
30102614 For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.
30102700 Go to the Roundtable Hold.
30102701 For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.
30103000 Ah, there you are.
30103001 You claimed a Great Rune, and had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold.
30103002 What was your impression?
30103010 Ah, there you are.
30103011 You've had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold.
30103012 What was your impression?
30103100 Ah-ha, your intuition serves you well.
30103101 My doubts had been piling up, you see.
30103102 ...The words of the Two Fingers cannot be trusted.
30103103 Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions.
30103104 I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance, skewed.
30103105 Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind.
30103106 That's the part that irks the most.
30103200 Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit only for the wise.
30103300 A means for circumventing the draw of the Two Fingers.
30103301 Give it a try, won't you?
30103302 And if it please you, may we meet again.
30103303 I've high hopes for you. My lambkin.
30103400 You don't say. Well, what a relief that must be.
30103401 You may go, then. My work here is done.
30103402 May the wisdom of the Two Fingers guide you.
30103500 Oh? Is something wrong?
30103600 Be sure to try that finger I gave you.
30103601 There's no reason to dither.
30103602 The Tarnished were spurned by grace, forsaken by the Two Fingers. And now they ask you to mend their crumbling world?
30103603 Hah, your loyalties are misplaced with them.
30103700 Be sure to try that finger I gave you.
30103701 I'm quite certain that you'll take to it.
30105000 Oh, lambkin, so pleased you're here.
30105001 I'm glad that you're enjoying my gift.
30105002 Mmm, I knew it from the very start.
30105003 You have a taste for noble blood.
30105004 ...
30105005 I wish to anoint you a proper inductee.
30105006 A knight to serve Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, and establish a new dynasty.
30105007 Luminary Mohg has strength, vision, and of course, love.
30105008 So, what do you say, my lambkin?
30105100 Mm, yes, who would have it any other way?
30105101 Now, take this.
30105105 For your final trial. Soak the cloth with a maiden's blood.
30105106 Normally, this ritual would involve killing one's own maiden, and recanting the wisdom of the Two Fingers.
30105107 But since you are maidenless, the blood of anyone's maiden will do.
30105200 Oh my, perhaps you misheard me.
30105201 Nothing wrong with giving you a day or two.
30105202 For your ears to clear out.
30105300 Oh, it's you.
30105301 Could you tell me once more? Your honest reply.
30105400 Ahh, my lambkin.
30105401 You've completed your final trial.
30105402 And with this, you are a formal inductee.
30105403 A knight who will assist Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, in the establishment of a new dynasty.
30105404 Now, give me your finger.
30105405 This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor, once it settles. Inside of you.
30105410 Oh, good heavens. Clench your teeth, or something.
30105415 Never forget that feeling of agony.
30105416 For it is what binds you, to Luminary Mohg. To all of us.
30105417 Ha ha ha...
30105418 You have the sweetest scream. My lambkin.
30105500 Oh, another thing. You should have this.
30105600 A medal granted by the new Mohgwyn dynasty.
30105601 With the power to grant audience with Luminary Mohg.
30105602 I've gone out of my way to provide one to you.
30105603 But you mustn't use it just yet.
30105604 The meeting must wait until the Mohgwyn dynasty commences.
30105605 Luminary Mohg yet slumbers beside the Divinity.
30105606 We must endure a little longer.
30105700 Ahh, it is trying, but we must be patient.
30105701 One day, you will be elevated, deservedly, basking in love.
30105702 Right, my lambkin?
30105703 Ha ha ha...
30105800 The cloth is your final trial. Soak it with the blood of a maiden.
30105801 The blood of anyone's maiden will do. You are maidenless, after all.
30108000 What business does a maidenless wretch like you have here?
30108001 Did you come seeking violence, upon learning my esteemed position under Luminary Mohg?
30108002 I'll take pleasure in ensuring you regret this.
30108003 Before you die in obscurity.
30108100 You seek violence, heedless of my warning, though you have been raised to a knight of the dynasty?
30108101 I am pained, to the very depths of my being.
30108102 I'll ensure you regret this, my lambkin.
30108103 Enjoy your miserable death.
30108200 How dare you trouble Luminary Mohg's passions.
30108201 You vulgar churl.
30108300 I made a grave error.
30108400 Why must I be...
30108401 Disgraced by this lowborn...
30108500 O...Luminary...Mohg...
30108501 Please grant...the strength...you promised...
30108502 I have given...everything...
30108503 Please...my lord...
30108600 Please, answer me...Luminary...Mohg.
30108601 ...
30108602 A-ahh...
30108603 Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love!
30108604 <groan>
30180000 Oh?
30180100 Do you even comprehend?
30180101 The gravity of this choice.
30180200 Very well.
30180201 If you mistake kindness for frailty of heart,
30180202 then perhaps a more physical lesson is in order!
30180300 You disappoint me.
30180301 Perhaps noble blood is too rich for the maidenless.
30180302 Well, no sense in sparing your life now.
30180400 You will die nameless, without ceremony.
30180500 How does it feel to die a failure?
30180600 You maidenless runt...
30180601 Who do you think I am?
30180602 <groan>
30180700 Luminary Mohg...
30180701 Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love!
30180702 <groan>
30200100 You there.
30200101 Come over here, would you?
30200200 You're Tarnished, aren't you?
30200201 I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle.
30200202 It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands.
30200203 Try the opening right here.
30200204 The guards don't know about it.
30200205 You'll breach the castle undetected.
30200300 Yes, that's the spirit.
30200301 ...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like.
30200302 I pray for your success.
30200400 Fair enough, you certainly don't have to trust me.
30200401 Well, If you must go through the gates, I'll signal them to open.
30200402 But of course, I'd advise against it.
30200500 Use that opening to breach the castle.
30200501 The guards haven't a clue about it.
30200502 You'll slip right inside undetected.
30200600 Of course. I understand.
30200601 When you approach the gates, I'll signal them to open.
30200602 It's only your neck on the line, after all.
30200700 The gates! Open the gates!
30200800 ...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like.
30200801 I pray for your success.
30200900 The gates are open. Do as you like.
30200901 It's only your neck on the line, after all.
30202000 Oh, oh, you...
30202001 Oh, great, I'm glad you're here.
30202002 Just a small reward, I was saving it for you.
30202003 Please, it's all yours.
30202100 Good, now let's be on our way, shall we?
30202101 Wouldn't want the guards to spot you.
30202200 Hop along, will you?
30202201 What'll happen if the guards catch you strutting about?
30202500 Rubbish...
30202501 Another one...another one all skin and bones.
30202502 ...Worse than a petty squire...
30202503 ...Ahh, not a muscle on this one either...
30202600 Oh, you...
30202601 For god's sake, don't scare me like that!
30202602 ...
30202603 What, oh, just clearing out some corpses.
30202604 Can't just leave them about, you know, they'll start to pong, eh.
30202700 Oh, hello. No, don't you mind me for a minute.
30202701 It's my job to keep the grounds clean.
30202800 <blank>
30204000 Oh, hello... Glad to see you safe.
30204001 I've come into some fine goods.
30204002 Only, it turns out I can't use a one of them.
30204003 Perhaps you'd like to take them off my hands?
30204100 Oh, hello, anything you'd care to purchase?
30204500 Fare thee well.
30204501 I pray for your success.
30205000 What a pathetic excuse for a Lord you were. Craven to the bone.
30205001 Pushing me about like that. And after all that grafting? Where did that get you?
30205002 Look down, on me, would you?
30205003 Godrick? You filthy slug.
30205004 Feel it! Feel it! Feel my bloody wrath!
30205100 Oh...hello there.
30205101 This weasel was... Godrick was always looking down on me.
30205102 He got what he bloody deserved, thanks to you.
30205103 I tell you though, what goes around comes around.
30205104 He had an ugly heart, an uglier countenance, and met the ugliest of ends, eh.
30205105 He he he he he...
30205200 Now, I suppose I'm free.
30205201 I can do whatever takes my fancy...
30205202 Can't I, mate?
30206000 You giving that to me?
30206001 ...
30206002 Well, I suppose I did save your life, in a way.
30206003 I'll gladly take it off your hands. Be rude not to, eh!
30206004 Mmm, you Tarnished are alright by me.
30206005 The sweet ones like you, anyway.
30206100 ...
30207000 Ah, you, is it?
30207001 Haven't seen your mug in quite some time.
30207002 As you can see, I'm the new Lady's attendant.
30207003 Freedom? Wasn't worth squat.
30207004 B-besides, I like it 'round 'ere...
30207005 Lady Nepheli's still fair of heart and countenance...
30207100 Still, I have the Lady's trust.
30207101 ...So I can loot all the corpses I like.
30207102 I'll let you take a look at the goods, if you fancy.
30207200 Ah, back again, are we? Curious one, you are.
30207201 Well then, what are you after?
30280000 Ouch!
30280100 Oi, what're you doing?
30280101 Stop that!
30280200 Blast, what's it to you!
30280201 Step back, you wretched Tarnished!
30280301 Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you...
30280400 Hah! Do you feel it?
30280401 Do you feel my bloody wrath?
30280500 Damn it all. Why is it always me...
30280501 What did I do to deserve...
30280600 But...I'm free...
30280601 I can do...what I like...
30290000 <blank>
30290001 <blank>
30290002 <blank>
30300100 Good Lord! Good God of Vengeance!
30300101 Till grudges soak the lands!
30300200 Oh...
30300201 I see, you're Tarnished.
30300202 I am Guilbert. A Redeemer of vengeance. In all its forms.
30300300 By the way...
30300301 Have you heard of the crucible knights?
30300302 There's one by the name of Ordovis, and I must find him.
30300303 He's an old hero of the Shattering, but there's a grudge out against him.
30300304 The Lands Between are brimming with those who cannot die. It makes for a cesspool of vengeance.
30300305 ...Gives me a shiver just thinking about it...
30300400 These fellows?
30300401 Who knows, just some lads who did someone wrong.
30300402 They got what was coming, nothing more.
30300403 If you're intent on revenge, pray to the God of Vengeance.
30300404 You'll have yourself a corpse in no time.
30300500 You're Tarnished. Then you're here to fight, aren't you?
30300501 For the Elden Ring.
30300502 Well, there's something you ought to know.
30300503 There's an aberration of a blacksmith past the checkpoint that leads to Stormveil.
30300504 He doesn't seem to think much of anyone or anything, but oddly, he's willing to smith weapons for Tarnished.
30300505 He has a fine arm. Have him take a crack at your goods.
30300506 ...The question for me, of course, is whether he's in need of any vengeance...
30300600 In the Lands Between, everyone lives longer than they should.
30300601 They may go mad, but even so, they plead to the God of Vengeance.
30300602 That's why I'm here. To exact revenge for those who can't do it themselves.
30300603 Like someone did for me, when I...when I was but a tyke.
30301000 Oh, there you are...
30301001 It must have been a dream. Strange.
30301002 I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis of the Crucible.
30301003 It was a revenge so sweet, fit to serve the very God of Vengeance.
30301004 Heh...
30301005 Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer, as well...
30301100 Ah, you...
30301101 Did you defeat Ordovis of the Crucible?
30301102 I could sense it. The God of Vengeance surely smiled upon that battle.
30301103 Heh...
30301104 Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer too...
30301300 Alright, then.
30301301 I'm off to Stormveil Castle.
30301302 Lord Godrick has kept busy with his grafting...
30301303 Slicing off arms like harvesting ears of wheat. He's run up a mighty debt in blood.
30301304 A demigod, yes, he may be...
30301305 But no one escapes a Redeemer.
30301400 I was thinking...
30301401 Godrick must have an idea.
30301402 About the vengeance sought by General Radahn, to whom I swore my oath.
30301403 ...Yes, Godrick's corpse will know what to do...
30301492 That of all the grudges born of the Shattering, Malenia the Rotted is the object of the most profound.
30301500 Ahh, my head is throbbing, everything is bright red...
30301501 Master Radahn, is this how it feels to ferment with vengeance?
30301502 I can hardly keep from trembling...
30390000 Well, well, you've made yourself a target of vengeance.
30390001 Perhaps this, too, was meant to be.
30390100 Hello there, I don't believe we've met.
30390101 I'm afraid you've made yourself the object of somebody's ire.
30390102 As a Redeemer, I'm bound to exact revenge.
30390200 Whoah, what're you playing at? (OK???, v303902000_ALT_3)
30390300 ...
30390301 This is a little awkward.
30390302 There's no revenge to be had in this killing.
30390400 Not too sharp, are you?
30390401 If you want to die, ask someone else.
30390500 <blank>
30390510 <blank>
30390520 <blank>
30390600 Let it be known.
30390601 Wherever vengeance must be had, a Redeemer there will be...
30390700 Oh, my Lord. Good God of Vengeance!
30390701 Till grudges soak the lands...
30390800 Don't you see now?
30390801 There is no escape from a Redeemer.
30390900 Death ought to be earned.
30390901 What am I to make of this?
30391000 Didn't I tell you before?
30391001 No one escapes a Redeemer.
30391002 Prepare to become an offering, once and for all.
30391003 Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.
30700100 I see... You must be Ranni's new hireling.
30700101 Yes, yes, I've heard all about you.
30700102 I am Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts.
30700103 I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you,
30700104 but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady,
30700105 I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you.
30700200 I reside...in another tower, close by.
30700201 Come and pay me a visit...
30700202 Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni.
30700203 If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you.
30700204 But who am I to stand against the wishes of my Lady?
30701000 Well, well. You took me at my word.
30701001 Did you not realise I was merely being polite? You provincials never cease to amaze...
30701002 Hmm, I suppose you're here now.
30701003 Perhaps I'll give you something to do.
30701004 I'd like you to find a woman called Nepheli, to administer a potion.
30701005 Even you can do that much, can't you?
30701100 Good, good.
30701101 Now I shall hand over the potion in question.
30701110 Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.
30701111 I expect glad tidings. And soon.
30701200 I see...
30701201 What a wretched bunch you Tarnished are.
30701202 Do you understand? I've given you a very fine chance.
30701203 If you complete this simple task, I will graciously permit you to learn from me.
30701204 Even you wish to serve our Lady well, do you not?
30701205 Turn those little cogs upstairs, and return with the correct answer.
30701300 Have you fumbled out the correct answer now?
30701301 Then you will undertake my task?
30701400 ...
30701401 You are peerless in your dullardry.
30701402 Fine. I can feel my wits evaporating in your mere presence.
30701403 Don't bother wasting your breath on me again.
30701500 I could have sworn I told you to trouble me no more...
30701501 Are you here to tender your sincere apology, and undertake my task?
30701600 Good, good.
30701601 As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology.
30701602 Now I shall hand over the potion in question.
30701610 Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.
30701611 I expect glad tidings. And soon.
30701700 I've no time for idle chit chat.
30701701 The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your task's completion.
30701702 Are we understood? Then off you trot.
30701703 I have enough on my plate.
30703000 Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion?
30703001 Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought.
30703002 Very well. Then you shall have your gift.
30703003 Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis.
30703004 I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but...
30703005 If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady.
30703100 You wish to begin right this moment?
30703101 Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it.
30703200 Begging for another lesson so soon?
30703201 There remains much to be done. Make it quick.
30703300 Come now, the pretence of comprehension becomes you not.
30703301 Bend over backwards any further and you're apt to break.
30704000 Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you?
30704001 The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not?
30704002 Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot.
30704003 Well...there's no helping it.
30704004 Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it.
30704005 There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave.
30704006 She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy.
30704007 I asked her to look into the matter some time ago.
30704008 I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her.
30704100 So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?
30704101 Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it.
30704102 It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe.
30704103 I may have expected too much of her, to begin with.
30705000 You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please?
30705001 Your oafishness knows no bounds.
30705002 Fine and well.
30705003 You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion.
30705004 I believe that makes you my accomplice.
30705005 You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm?
30705006 Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed.
30705007 But perhaps I can make a very special exception.
30705008 Now, choose.
30706000 How's the puppet I gave you?
30706001 A thing of exquisite craft, is it not?
30707000 What's that? You want another puppet?
30707001 Quite the keen paramour, aren't we.
30707002 But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me.
30707003 I can hardly just give them away.
30707004 Oh dear, what's to be done?
30707005 Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards?
30707006 If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you.
30707007 The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few.
30707008 And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them.
30707009 Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road.
30708000 You're proving to be quite the puppeteer.
30708001 I've not had an apprentice for�a very long time indeed.
30708100 Perhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine?
30708101 It will produce the finest of puppets.
30708102 Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands.
30708103 A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound?
30708200 Ahh, I knew I had you pegged.
30708201 You're just like me.
30708202 Then I'd like you to procure something.
30708203 A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.
30708204 With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.
30708205 And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...
30708250 Procure it for me.
30708251 The rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.
30708252 With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.
30708253 And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...
30708300 Very good.
30708301 A wise choice, indeed.
30708302 You passed my little test with flying colours.
30708303 I was merely gauging your loyalty to Lady Ranni.
30708304 Well done, I'm very proud of you.
30708305 Let's both do our utmost in service of our Lady.
30708400 Ah ha. Might you be interested after all?
30708401 In a fine scheme to sport with Lady Ranni?
30708500 Alright, enough of these games.
30708501 Your test is well and truly over.
30708502 Wag your tail for master all you like, but your loyalty is merely blind.
30708503 I fear your wretched provinciality is apt to burst. You're oozing at the seams.
30709000 Well, well, you managed to lay your hands on it!
30709001 The blessed day is finally upon us...
30709002 Goodness gracious, the way it glistens...utterly enchanting.
30709003 To think, this was once a demigod's very fate...
30709004 My oh my oh my...
30709100 Ah, are you still here?
30709101 Oh yes, I should give you your reward.
30709102 Please, it's all yours. Splendid work. Just marvellous.
30709110 Now, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin.
30709111 The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...
30709200 Good, I've been waiting for you.
30709201 It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet.
30709202 Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it.
30709210 The dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably.
30709211 Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona�she's a frail, gentle girl at heart.
30709300 You...understand, don't you?
30709301 That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition.
30709302 And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted.
30709303 Just imagine...the pure elation...
30709400 Come now, don't make me wait.
30709401 I can barely contain myself as it is...
30709500 You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you.
30709501 The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...
30710000 Hmm. Is that a scroll?
30710001 I won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but...
30710002 You're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it.
30710003 So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands.
30710004 That said, don't you dare get your hopes up.
30710005 More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect�
30710006 �upon the mediocrity of one's intellect.
30711000 Oh, perhaps you've already noticed.
30711001 The nightly wolf howling that's been disturbing the peace here.
30711002 If that bothersome mutt, Blaidd, is back in town,
30711003 then tell him to pack up and ship out.
30711004 I never liked the din of a dog's howl.
30711005 From a mongrel like him, it's simply agony.
30712000 Well, what have we here?
30712001 Are you proposing that I partake?
30712002 Do I appear such a gormless tomfool to you?
30712003 A slow-wit who'd divulge his secrets for a moment of bliss?
30712004 Well, let me give you some advice.
30712005 Scheming has its place, but consider the one you're scheming against.
30712006 You might find yourself on the wrong end of a proper beating one day.
30720000 O-oh!
30720001 Y-you! I, er, sorry, your worship...
30720002 I-I apologise for any offence given.
30720003 I am Pidia. Servant to the Carian royal family.
30720004 I am charged with maintaining these g-ghastly dolls.
30720100 Ahh, your worship, allow me to be of use.
30720101 Other than the puppets, there are some very fine things up here in this storeroom.
30720102 Why not pick something out, before you go?
30720103 But please, can you offer poor ill-starred Pidia...
30720104 A little something by way of compensation?
30720200 Ah, a fine day to your worship.
30720201 Please, choose whatever you like.
30720300 Ah, I'm sorry your worship, but poor Pidia has given all he has.
30720301 I can't be of further use to you. Please, forgive me.
30720400 Please, find it in your heart... Forgive me...
30720500 Argh!
30720501 Arrgh!
30720502 S-stop, please, stop!
30720503 Y-you're my puppets! I loved you with all I have!
30720504 How could you forget...such bliss?
30720505 Ouch!
30720506 That hurts!
30720507 Please, I beg you, cease this cruelty!
30720550 Eeek
30720551 Eeeeeeek!
30721000 Oh, that's very kind.
30721001 Poor Pidia could never accept such a precious brew.
30721002 Very sorry, really, if I... I've disappointed you,
30721003 If you will, please forget this matter entirely.
30780000 Agh!
30780100 Enough of that, now.
30780101 Have you forgotten that we both serve the same Lady?
30780200 You incorrigible lout.
30780201 Don't you dare waltz back here ever again.
30780210 ...
30900100 Well, well, well?
30900101 Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?
30900102 You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!
30900103 Cough up your coin, all of it!
30900200 Wait, wait, please!
30900201 I surrender! White flag and all!
30900300 For Pete's sake! I concede!
30900301 No one likes a bull-headed brute, you know!
30900302 I yield, yield! You can't harm a yielding man!
30900400 Cripes, are you dense, boy?
30900401 Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.
30900402 We're about to make out like Bandits, boys!
30900500 Well, finally come around, have you?
30900501 I knew you would. You're a man of reason, through-and-through.
30900502 Ha ha ha...
30900600 Ahhh...
30900601 Well, what do you know? You're Tarnished, like me.
30900602 Now, how did I get that wrong?
30900603 I took you for a demi-human, or some such.
30900604 An innocent mistake, I assure you.
30900605 Well, water under the bridge. Now we're squared up, how about we play nice from now on?
30900700 A true man of reason. Just what I like about you.
30900701 I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered.
30900702 Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say.
30900703 Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits they're paying for my gruel.
30900704 In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes.
30900705 But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying.
30900706 Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop.
30900707 So, don't be a stranger, eh?
30900708 I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.
30900709 Ha ha ha...
30900800 Slow down, son...
30900801 What's the matter? This simply isn't like you.
30900802 You've always known an innocent mistake when you see one.
30900803 Well, suit yourself.
30900804 I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered.
30900805 Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say.
30900806 Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits are paying for my gruel.
30900807 In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes.
30900808 But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying.
30900809 I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop.
30900810 So, don't be a stranger, eh?
30900811 I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.
30900812 Ha ha ha...
30900900 Don't forget to pop back for another visit, friend.
30900901 I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.
30902000 Well, nice of you to drop in, finally.
30902001 It's all a bit ad hoc, but I'm sure you'll find something.
30902002 And welcome to Patches' Emporium.
30902003 Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything's top notch.
30902100 Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.
30902200 Cheers for that.
30902300 Stingy little beggar...
30902301 Try to find it in your heart next time, eh?
30902400 Yeah, I had those bandits make a clean break.
30902401 Now they're all suppliers, and good ones at that.
30902402 I mean, they don't understand a word I'm saying,
30902403 but it hardly matters, we have a natural connection.
30902404 They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army.
30902405 Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish.
30902406 ...It's the same old story, everywhere I go. Ah, to hell with it all.
30902500 Hm? Wondering what's inside the treasure chest?
30902501 Well, it's uh, nothing too special.
30902502 Just something I'm saving as thanks, for a very valuable customer...
30902503 But then again, it would fetch some spectacular coin...
30902504 And besides, this valuable customer could be a long time coming...
30902505 Eh? Everything is give and take, give and take.
30902600 Forgot something on your shopping list?
30902601 No, no trouble to me.
30904100 By the way, friend...
30904101 You've really been there for me, through thick and thin.
30904102 And so, I've made up my mind. I bequeath that chest to you.
30904103 An extra-special thanks, for an extra-special customer.
30904200 What's wrong? I've made up my mind.
30904201 The treasure chest is yours, in word and deed.
30904202 Sure, it may be worth its weight in gold.
30904203 But a Patches Promise? Well, that's priceless!
30905000 Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.
30905001 You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.
30905002 Maybe it's a sign to keep your mitts off what's not rightly yours, hmm?
30905003 But I'll forgive you. View it as a learning experience.
30905004 At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.
30905005 And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!
30905100 Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.
30905101 You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.
30905102 Who on earth spends their time booby-trapping treasure chests?
30905103 No way I could've known, but still, I apologise. It's all very unfortunate.
30905104 At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.
30905105 And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!
30906000 Oh yes, by the way. I'm saying goodbye to the old cave.
30906001 I'm untethered, by nature, and It's about time that I moved on.
30906002 No worries, the old gang will inherit the shop.
30906003 They may not speak a word, but they never forget a face.
30906004 Spare them some coin after I'm gone, eh?
30907000 Oh, well! It's been a long while.
30907001 It's me. Patches the Untethered.
30907002 I'm still in business, if you can believe it.
30907003 Now I'm my only supplier, so I haven't got much, but everything here is top notch.
30907004 Patches' Emporium, now open in Raya Lucaria.
30907100 You have yourself a discerning eye, I can tell.
30907101 That statuette will net you a small fortune, no doubt.
30907102 In fact, I'll bet any of those scruffy merchants would leap at the chance to buy it...
30907103 (laughs)
30907200 Oh, really? No interest in the statuette?
30907201 I was sure it would catch your eye.
30907202 Well, I can't force it on you, but...
30907203 Incomparable craftsmanship, you know. I'd hate to see it go to someone else...
30907300 By the way, have you met that girl Rya?
30907301 She's a strange one, but I believe she was in need of help.
30907302 Not that it's any of my business, but...
30907303 If she rings your bell, why not lend her an ear?
30907400 Looking for Rya? Still hanging around on the high road, I suppose.
30908000 Oh, hello. I knew it'd all be fine...
30908001 Oh, it's nothing, don't mind me. Welcome to Patches' Emporium!
30908100 You're...making your way to the Erdtree, no?
30908101 Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination.
30908102 Have you ever seen an iron virgin?
30908103 The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels.
30908104 ...but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition.
30908105 And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
30908106 Its transpositional powers fully intact.
30908107 So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose...
30908108 It'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told...
30908109 Ha ha...ha ha...
30908200 Oh yeah, great story isn't it. I'll tell you as many times as you like.
30908201 There's a surviving Iron Virgin at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
30908202 And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree.
30908203 Heh heh...ha ha...
30909000 Well, fancy meeting you here.
30909001 Hold on, don't you say a word, my friend.
30909002 I spoke no lie, not a one.
30909003 You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake,
30909004 but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out.
30909005 I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear.
30909006 But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right?
30910100 Oh, erm, hello, yes.
30910101 Strange place for a chance encounter, eh?
30910102 Thought I could use a rest. Don't mind me, go about your business.
30910103 Right, over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.
30910200 What is it? Oh, don't mind me. Off you trot.
30910201 Right over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.
30911000 Oh, my, well, here you are again.
30911001 So sorry for that. I meant to warn you, but whoops! There you went.
30911002 Despite my best intentions, I've done you wrong, I have.
30911003 But here you are, standing tall and proud. All's well that ends well, eh.
30911004 And my warning was spot-on, you tell me different!
30911005 Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.
30911006 I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals.
30912000 Well, you've joined the Manor, eh?
30912001 I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you.
30912002 And here I thought Rya was barking up the wrong tree...
30912003 All good, though. We're on the same side, now.
30912004 We'll do good work together.
30912010 Well, you've joined the Manor, eh?
30912011 I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you.
30912012 All good, though. We're on the same side, now.
30912013 We'll do good work together.
30912100 Oh, and of course, we can do business, if you like.
30912101 Patches' Emporium at the Volcano Manor. Specially for you.
30913000 Ahh, hello, what impeccable timing.
30913001 This is for you.
30913100 You're new here at the Manor.
30913101 But if you complete the request, you can improve your standing.
30913102 Relax, we're old friends. Time's come to pass the torch, right?
30913103 Go on, break a leg, then.
30913104 Heh heh...
30913200 What's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey?
30913201 Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon.
30913202 We're not here to make your life easier.
30913203 Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree.
30913204 Dare I say your heart was never in it to begin with?
30913300 What's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey?
30913301 Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon.
30913302 We're not here to make your life easier.
30913303 Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree.
30913304 You and Diallos both. Perhaps your hearts were never in it to begin with?
30913400 You hunted down Tragoth?
30913401 Are you certain?
30913402 No, it's quite alright, fine work, indeed.
30913403 I'll give Tanith the news.
30913404 Have some rest, by all means.
30913500 Are you surprised? That I belong to the Volcano Manor.
30913501 I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers.
30913502 I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade.
30913503 Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious.
30913504 I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it.
30913505 Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud.
30913506 I've never seen a woman quite like her...
30913600 Hmph.
30913601 Sharper than you seem, aren't you...
30913602 I was just holding onto it for you, you know.
30913603 Here you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours.
30915000 Now you've gone and killed Rykard?
30915001 You scheming little bastard.
30915002 Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical...
30915003 Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all...
30915004 But for now, this Manor is finished.
30915005 The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head.
30915006 A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy.
30915007 Heh heh...ha ha...
30915008 Well, here I am. Untethered, once again.
30915009 Good-bye, my friend.
30915100 What is it?
30915101 Oh, come to make a parting donation to Patches' Emporium?
30916000 Ah, oh, you again...
30916001 A shame you had to see me like this...
30916002 Ohh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all.
30916003 I should have stuck to what I know best...
30916004 No matter. I know I-I can trust you.
30916005 Gullible, yes, but a good soul.
30916006 Make certain that Tanith gets this.
30916008 C'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong.
30916100 You're able, then?
30916101 Then I can rest easy, my friend...
30917000 Well, well, well?
30917001 Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?
30917002 You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!
30917003 Cough up your coin, all of it!
30917100 Hm? Wait, don't tell me, is that you?
30917101 Oh, cripes, please, wait!
30917200 Do you even hear me? I said "surrender", loud and clear!
30917201 No one likes a bull-headed brute!
30917202 You'd clobber your old mate, then, would you?
30917300 Cripes! Are you dense, mate?
30917301 What in the world has gotten into you!
30917302 Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.
30917303 Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!
30917400 Well, glad to see we're on the same page.
30917401 I'd never cross you, not even close.
30917500 Ahhh...
30917501 It's been ages since I've seen you.
30917502 I didn't even realise it was you.
30917503 Took you for a demi-human, or some such.
30917504 You know how it is, just an innocent mistake.
30917505 Water under the bridge, eh, back to business as usual?
30917600 Hell's bells...
30917601 This bandit business is hardly what it's cracked up to be...
30917602 Especially if we keep running into the likes of you...
30917603 ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...
30917700 ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...
30919000 Well, finally made it, eh, and just in time.
30919001 For the grand reopening of Patches' Emporium.
30919002 Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything is top notch!
30919100 Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.
30919200 Cheers for that.
30919300 What, do I have to beg?
30919301 Give us a coin or two next time around, will you?
30919400 Forgot something on your shopping list?
30919401 No trouble to me.
30920000 Booze, eh? Good stuff, by the look of it.
30920001 But, er, I'm alright, thanks.
30920002 As my dear nan used to say, "there's no such thing as a free lunch"...
30920100 ...
30980000 Ngh!
30980001 What are you playing at? That bloody well hurts!
30980200 What's wrong with you?
30980201 It's me, Patches. Patches!
30980202 Enough now, stop!
30980300 Ugh. Hard of hearing, are we?
30980301 Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming!
30980302 Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!
30980600 Last chance to surrender, mate.
30980601 Grovel...and I'll forgive you.
30981000 Well... It was bound to happen some day...
30981001 What a shit show...
30982000 Try not to be so slow on the uptake, eh.
30982100 There's a special circle, for rotten thieves like you.
30983000 Well, it looks like you've seen the error of your ways.
30983001 ...
30983002 Water under the bridge. Am I wrong?
30983003 We'll call it a momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.
30983004 So, what can I do you for today?
30983010 Well, it looks like you've seen the error of your ways.
30983011 ...
30983012 Water under the bridge. Am I wrong?
30983013 We'll call it a momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.
30984000 Okay, I can see you mean it.
30984001 Consider it water under the bridge.
30984002 A momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.
30984100 So. Do you need something from me?
31000100 Hello? Is somebody there?
31000101 Might I bend your ear for a moment, please.
31000102 My name is Irina. I've escaped from Castle Morne, to the south.
31000103 The servants there...have rebelled.
31000104 I-I can't be sure what it is, my eyesight's been weak since birth you see...
31000105 But I swear I heard frightful howling from all over.
31000106 My good father secreted me out the castle,
31000107 but decided himself to stay. He says it's his duty, as commander.
31000200 I understand.
31000201 I fear some of the castle's servants are still prowling nearby.
31000202 Do take care on the road. I pray your journey comes to fruition.
31000203 And if you happen to change your mind...
31000204 Please come to see me again.
31000300 Hello? Is somebody there?
31000301 Ah, you're the one from before, aren't you?
31000302 Please, I implore you.
31000303 Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle?
31000304 My sole wish is that he escape,
31000305 Please...I just need him to be safe...
31000400 Thank you, dearly.
31000401 Then please, take this.
31000450 Deliver it to my father, who remains in the castle, if you please.
31000500 Please, if you wouldn't mind. Deliver the letter to my father at the castle.
31000501 He can be stubborn, but I'm sure he'll come around.
31000600 I...I fear for father's life.
31000601 The servants are full wroth. Filled with hatred for every one of us.
31000602 They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with.
31000603 I fear it's no different at Castle Morne...
31000604 Please, I implore you.
31000605 Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle?
31000606 My sole wish is that he escape,
31000607 Please...I just want him to be safe...
31001000 Hello? Is someone there?
31001001 My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light.
31001002 If I might be so bold as to ask...
31001003 Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me?
31001004 My eyesight has been weak since birth, you see.
31001005 But when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel a distant light
31001006 It will lead me, to my true duty, as a Finger Maiden.
31001100 Hello? Is someone there?
31001101 Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me?
31001102 I'm on a pilgrimage in search of the distant light.
31001103 And when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel the light
31001200 Oh, many thanks to you.
31001201 Now I can feel the distant light once more.
31001202 You are most kind, indeed.
31001203 May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.
31001300 You're not like the others who give me grapes, are you...
31001301 They rest their trembling hands upon me.
31001302 Howling wordlessly, they gently stroke my eyes.
31001303 Their frail fingers, emaciated... Yet still, they give me the grapes.
31001304 But you...seem somehow...firmer.
31001400 Oh, many thanks to you.
31001401 Now I can feel the distant light once more.
31001402 That aside, I wonder what Shabriri grapes really are?
31001403 Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing...
31001404 What a sight they must be to behold.
31001500 N-No... That's not possible...
31001501 Not all of those people... Their own...
31001502 So those noises I heard were...
31001503 ...
31001504 <retching>
31001505 Sorry... I'm alright now.
31001506 Don't mind me...
31001600 ...
31001700 Ah, is that you over there?
31001701 I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you.
31001702 The reason why it was eyes I had to eat.
31001703 The distant light is far and frail.
31001704 So faint it can't be seen by the naked eye.
31001705 But with everyone's eyes together, it appears.
31001706 Finally, it all makes sense.
31001707 I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden.
31001900 You are most kind, indeed.
31001901 May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.
31002000 You are most kind, indeed.
31002001 May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.
31002100 I wonder, what are Shabriri grapes?
31002101 Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing...
31002102 What a sight they must be to behold.
31002200 I apologise. You only did as I asked.
31002201 I'll be fine. Think no more of it.
31002300 I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you.
31002301 I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden.
31003000 Oh hello, is that you over there?
31003001 Have you ever heard of fingerprint grapes?
31003002 They're special grapes which only grow on those
31003003 I would truly love to try one...
31003004 The distant light seems far closer than before,
31003005 But I can't sense a thing from the usual grapes anymore...
31003006 Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me?
31003007 Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.
31003100 Oh, Oh!
31003101 A fingerprint grape, tried and true, what a wondrous thing! A fingerprint grape!
31003102 Ohh, how sweet, yet, how it burns...
31003103 Thank you. I've composed myself again.
31003104 May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.
31003200 Oh, that's right.
31003201 ...Might I ask a boon of you?
31003202 Look after this for me, if you please.
31003250 It's been so long, I don't know how I came upon it,
31003251 Now I'm to be a Maiden though, it'll never find its way home.
31003252 Which is why I'd like you to have it.
31003253 It must be very, very precious indeed.
31003300 They're special grapes which only grow on those
31003301 Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me?
31003302 Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.
31003400 Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
31003401 I'm sure I'll be a Finger Maiden.
31004000 Ah, so you're here as well, are you?
31004001 ...I realised as we've talked.
31004002 I'll be a Maiden, and you... Surely, a Lord.
31004003 Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions.
31004004 It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you.
31004005 May the flame of chaos find purchase within you.
31004100 Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions.
31004101 It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you.
31005000 Ahh, the flame of chaos has nestled within you.
31005001 Could you please rest your hand upon me?
31005002 Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden...
31005100 Oh, it burns...
31005101 My eyes, my eyes, they're melting...
31005102 Aaargh!
31005103 ...
31005200 Could you please rest your hand upon me?
31005201 Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden...
31005300 ...
31005301 Thank...thank you...
31005302 I have touched them. The words of the Three Fingers.
31005303 As your maiden, allow me to divine them.
31005304 All that there is came from the One Great.
31005305 Then came fractures, and births, and souls.
31005306 But the Greater Will made a mistake.
31005307 Torment, despair, affliction. Every sin, every curse.
31005308 Every one, born of the mistake.
31005309 And so, what was borrowed must be returned.
31005310 Melt it all away, with the yellow chaos flame.
31005311 Until all is One again.
31005400 Those who gave me grapes howled without words.
31005401 Saying they wished they were never born.
31005402 Become their lord.
31005403 Take their torment, despair. Their affliction. Every sin, every curse.
31005404 And melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos.
31005405 No more fractures. No more birth...
31005450 ...
31080000 Agh!
31080100 What's happened to you?
31080101 Please, you must stop this.
31080200 Ah, why on earth?
31080201 I do not wish to cause anyone harm.
31080300 Oh, bless the stars.
31080301 You've chosen to reconsider.
31080400 Father...
31080401 Please, be safe...
31080500 Ahh, the distant light...fades...
31080501 I'm so sorry, my dears...
31100100 Ah, there's a face I've not seen before.
31100101 I'm Edgar, warden of this castle as ordained by Lord Godrick himself.
31100102 But you can see how things have turned out.
31100103 The menials have all rebelled.
31100104 They gave me good service, or so I thought,
31100105 Foul creatures, as it's said.
31100106 I'm sorry to disappoint you,
31100107 But whatever you've come here to do,
31100108 Take this, by way of apology.
31100200 Now then, away with you.
31100201 You've no reason to risk your neck dawdling here, eh.
31100300 I see, from Irina...
31100301 Thank you. I'm in your debt.
31100302 But I can't leave yet.
31100303 Even if the castle should fall, as commander, I must remain.
31100304 To ensure the treasured sword of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands.
31100400 If you see Irina, do tell her.
31100401 That her father will come for her, once he's fulfilled his duty.
31101000 I'm in your debt.
31101001 For keeping the sword from those fallen creatures.
31101002 I'm no longer bound by duty.
31101003 Once I've rescued Irina, I will spend my remaining days with her.
31101100 Thanks to you, I will be reunited with Irina.
31101101 And devote my remaining days to her.
31101102 Irina has a gentle nature, though.
31101103 I only hope it remains intact.
31102000 Irina...
31102001 How could this be�
31102002 My daughter deserved better�
31102003 The fault lies...with me.
31102004 I chose duty over my daughter's safety.
31102005 And that is how fate has answered�
31102100 I'll find them.
31102101 The foul wretches responsible for this.
31102102 I'll hunt them down, and exterminate every last one of them.
31102103 Rest assured, Irina. It will be done.
31180000 Ugh!
31180100 What's this about?
31180101 We need not fight, I assure you.
31180200 I haven't a clue what's got into you,
31180201 but as Lord of this castle, I will stand for it no longer!
31180300 And now even your ilk have complicated matters.
31180400 Please, enlighten me.
31180401 What was the purpose of such folly?
31180500 Please forgive me, Lord Godrick.
31180600 No, not here, not yet�
31180601 Forgive me, Iri�na�
31181000 Ugh!
31181100 What's the matter?
31181101 Cease this at once.
31181200 Ah, now I see!
31181201 You had a hand in Irina's undoing!
31181202 What could she have done to deserve that?
31181300 I will not rest until they are eliminated.
31181400 Forgive me, Irina�
31181401 I will join you soon enough�
31200100 Oh, Tarnished, are you?
31200101 How did you slip inside, with the gate closed?
31200102 Hmph. No matter.
31200103 If you can fell one of them, you're a champion, in my book.
31200104 I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness.
31200105 Incidentally, do you like a good festival, from time to time?
31200106 Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished.
31200107 But when the stars align, we celebrate.
31200108 A war festival honoring the last battle and death of General Radahn,
31200109 the mightiest demigod of the Shattering, and bearer of a Great Rune.
31200200 Well, good.
31200201 As you should. The festival affords glory to warriors.
31200202 Then all you need is a little patience.
31200203 When the stars align, the festival will be declared.
31200300 Well, you're not much fun, are you, chum?
31200301 No matter. One day you will see.
31200302 That true warriors bask in glory at the festival.
31200400 Have patience, mm.
31200401 When the stars align, the festival will be declared.
31200500 Go on, now.
31200501 This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.
31200600 One day you will see, chum.
31200601 That true warriors bask in glory at the festival.
31200700 Go on, now.
31200701 This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.
31202000 Well, I haven't heard that name in an age.
31202001 Then you must serve Princess Ranni?
31202002 The next time you speak to Iji, tell him this:
31202003 The festival of Radahn will surely set Ranni's fate back into motion.
31202004 By the by� Is that old fool still hammering out weapons?
31202005 His enormous frame, cramped in that little place...
31202006 Bit of a haughty sort. Strange fella, when I knew him.
31202007 And funny thing, his swords were all blunt as stone.
31202008 But not one of them decayed when faced with the scarlet rot...
31203000 Champions, welcome!
31203001 The stars have aligned! The festival is nigh!
31203002 General Radahn, mightiest demigod of the Shattering, awaits you!
31203003 Champions, prepare for battle! Defeat the General, claim glory, and grab that Great Rune!
31203004 A celebration of war! The Radahn Festival!
31203100 Are you good and prepared, young chum?
31203101 The festival begins!
31203400 But now, we must make merry.
31203401 O gathering of champions, the revels begin!
31203402 The celebration of war! The Radahn Festival!
31203500 You will find the field of battle past the church ahead, upon the shore under the fort.
31203501 General Radahn is there, even now.
31203502 Divested of his wits, devouring corpses�
31203503 And howling at the sky...
31203600 I see...
31203601 When you are ready, come to me again.
31204000 At last, the war festival has ended.
31204001 Brave champion, you have our gratitude.
31204002 The celebration was spectacular. General Radahn is surely pleased.
31204003 Festering with rot, and crippled by madness, all he wanted was an honourable death.
31204100 Finally, my work is done.
31204101 I am no longer bound to this fortress.
31204102 I have a task in mind.
31204103 Old business you could say. You wouldn't understand.
31204104 May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion.
31204200 It's time I went on my way.
31204201 May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion.
31205000 Ah, well met.
31205001 I hardly expected to see the champion of the festival here of all places.
31205002 You didn't...know Sellen, did you?
31205003 Well, whatever the case, she's dead now.
31205004 Just put it behind you.
31205005 She was known as the Graven Witch.
31205006 Obsessed by the primeval current, countless sorcerers fell to her hand.
31205007 The most dangerous mage in the entire history of Raya Lucaria's Academy.
31205100 Oh, a Tarnished, are you?
31205101 You didn't...know Sellen, did you?
31205102 Well, whatever the case, she's dead now.
31205103 Just put it behind you.
31205104 She was known as the Graven Witch.
31205105 Obsessed by the primeval current, countless sorcerers fell to her hand.
31205106 The most dangerous mage in the entire history of Raya Lucaria's Academy.
31205200 It is strange, though...
31205201 The woman, she was like a husk, her soul already fled.
31205202 I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere.
31205203 I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body.
31205204 A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me.
31205300 I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere.
31205301 I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body.
31205302 A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me.
31206000 My thanks, for the aid given.
31206001 I heard from Iji that Lady Ranni might have found herself a champion.
31206002 But I didn't know he was talking about you.
31206003 You've helped me fulfil an old promise.
31206004 This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.
31206100 My thanks, for the aid given.
31206101 Always a pleasure to witness the festival champ put on a display.
31206102 You've helped me fulfil an old promise.
31206103 This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.
31206200 My thanks, Tarnished, for the aid given.
31206201 You've helped me fulfil an old promise.
31206202 This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.
31206300 Well, I must be leaving now.
31206301 Brave warrior, if the fates deign it...
31206302 No, we shall indeed meet again, at the next glorious tourney.
31206400 Well, I must be leaving now.
31206401 If the fates deign it, may we meet again, Tarnished.
31280000 Ugh!
31280010 What's the matter with you?
31280011 You trying to get revenge?
31280020 Ugh!
31280030 What's the matter with you?
31280100 Very well.
31280101 If the Graven Witch put you under her spell, you must be eliminated...
31280102 Before you can pose a threat to Caria.
31280200 Rest now. Alongside the witch's corpse.
31280300 You...are a menace...
31280301 Iji...beware...
31280400 Sellen, Graven Witch, enemy of Caria.
31280401 I vow this time to crush both your frame and your primal glintstone.
31280402 I am Jerren, bringer of your death. Do not forget.
31280500 Very well.
31280501 You must be eliminated...
31280502 Before you can pose a threat to Caria.
31300100 Hello... Hello...
31300101 Please... Over here...
31300200 Hello... Hello...
31300201 Right over here...
31300300 Hello.
31300301 It's rather chilly here, isn't it?
31300302 My mistress sent me off on an errand...
31300303 But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind.
31300304 Could I ask you lend a hand, perhaps?
31300305 That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it.
31300306 Only... He, too, is Tarnished.
31300307 If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another...
31300400 Ohh, thank you dearly.
31300401 What a blessing that we've met like this.
31300402 The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...
31300403 Please, I must have the necklace back.
31300500 Yes, I see. Most unfortunate, but I'll have to make do.
31300501 I know that some Tarnished balk at the thought of harming their own.
31300502 But if you should change your mind, do not hesitate to speak to me again.
31300600 Have you had a change of heart?
31300700 The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...
31300701 Please, I must have the necklace back.
31301000 Oh, yes, that is my missing necklace.
31301001 Thank you kindly. I am in your debt.
31301002 Did I forget to announce myself?
31301003 I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor.
31301004 I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house.
31301005 You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,
31301006 but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind.
31301007 Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks.
31301008 Please, take this.
31301010 Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree.
31301011 Most Tarnished are doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree...
31301012 But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven,
31301013 the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions.
31301100 Ohh, and... One more thing, only for you...
31301101 This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road.
31301102 But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage.
31301103 Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff.
31301104 At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.
31301105 It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.
31301106 I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.
31301107 I do hope that we can meet again.
31301200 I've been waiting for you.
31301201 I knew you had the stuff of champions.
31301202 I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor.
31301203 Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.
31301400 Very well.
31301401 Speak to me again once you are ready.
31301402 You will find me here.
31301500 Are you ready, then?
31301501 I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor.
31301502 Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.
31301600 Give me your hand.
31301601 I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.
31302100 Brave Tarnished, what is your business here?
31302101 I'm afraid this is not a guest room.
31302102 What's that peculiar look upon your face?
31302103 <gasp>
31302104 Goodness, am I still a serpent?
31302105 Oh, how dreadful...
31302106 How dreadful indeed...
31302107 Forgive my distress.
31302108 I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance.
31302109 Brave Tarnished.
31302110 This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas.
31302111 Please forgive the deception.
31302112 Do understand. This duplicity is my own doing.
31302113 Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems.
31302200 Lady Tanith is my mother.
31302201 I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king.
31302202 That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit.
31302203 I am proud of what I am.
31302204 But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, they wouldn't speak to me.
31302205 And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits.
31302206 But you are not like the rest.
31302300 My serpentine form, and the name Zorayas,
31302301 were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I.
31302302 Now I share the secrets with you, as well.
31302303 Please keep them safe from anyone else.
31302400 Seek the old ruins in the cliff.
31302401 At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.
31302402 It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.
31302403 I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.
31302404 I do hope that we can meet again.
31303000 Hello again. Brave Tarnished.
31303001 As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor.
31303002 Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
31303100 Have you ever...
31303101 heard any strange sounds here at the manor?
31303102 Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales...
31303103 Oh fie, what am I saying?
31303104 It just isn't possible. I must be tired.
31303200 Um, oh, it's you.
31303201 Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late.
31303202 Hmm, well...
31303203 I know I can trust you...
31303204 I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night.
31303205 It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.
31303206 If I'm not mistaken,
31303207 it took the form of a serpent, just like me...
31303208 Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret,
31303209 that Lady Tanith has kept from me?
31303210 I realise that I shouldn't impose but,
31303211 if you discover anything, would you please share?
31303300 The serpent that lurked in the shadows that night...
31303301 It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.
31303302 Perhaps the manor yet holds some secrets.
31303303 If you discover anything, would you please share?
31303400 Really...
31303401 Oh, so there was a secret after all...
31303402 Oh my...
31303403 Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...
31303404 Was I not...
31303405 born by the grace of a king?
31303500 Hello again. Brave Tarnished.
31303501 It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand,
31303502 but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.
31303503 Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
31303600 Hello again. Brave Tarnished.
31303601 Do you remember me? I am Rya. We spoke once in Liurnia.
31303602 I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.
31303603 Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
31303700 A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished.
31303701 I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor.
31303702 Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
31303800 Brave Tarnished.
31303801 Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.
31303900 Sometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls.
31303901 Like breathing, or slithering scales.
31303902 Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired.
31304000 Hmm, what is this?
31304001 I remember this scent, distinctly.
31304002 ...
31304003 Funny, isn't it.
31304004 I am certain of it. I was born inside this.
31304005 It's a part of my birth mother.
31304006 You have my gratitude.
31304007 Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid.
31304008 I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.
31304009 One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.
31304100 Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...
31304101 Was I not...
31304102 born by the grace of a king?
31304200 I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.
31304201 One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.
31305000 Oh, it's you...
31305001 I'm afraid... there is something I must tell you.
31305002 I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual.
31305003 Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents.
31305004 Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me.
31305005 I know that you have done so much for me.
31305006 But I wish to ask one last kindness.
31305007 Kill me, please.
31305008 I thought that I feared nothing. But this...
31305009 Free me from this accursed frame.
31305100 Agh...
31305101 Thank you... My champion...
31305102 Mother...
31305200 I'm to drink this, then?
31305201 Yes, of course. You always were very kind.
31305205 ...
31305206 Ahh... How delightfully sweet...
31305207 And yet...
31306000 I know that you have done so much for me.
31306001 But I wish to ask one last kindness.
31306002 Kill me, please.
31306003 I thought that I feared nothing. But this...
31306004 Free me from this accursed frame.
31306100 You're not willing to kill me, are you.
31306101 Hah...
31306102 You've always been so kind. And uncompromising.
31306200 I suppose I knew in my heart of hearts.
31306201 How kind, and uncompromising, you always were.
31307000 ...
31307100 Oh, it's you.
31307101 Heaven knows what happened here,
31307102 but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone.
31307103 It feels rather quiet without them.
31307104 But with you here, things will be just fine.
31307200 I await Lady Tanith.
31307201 I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king.
31307202 I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern.
31307203 Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour.
31307204 I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes.
31380000 Please, stop, Brave Tarnished.
31380001 You will only tire by striking this barrier.
31380100 Besides, I am no foe of yours.
31380101 Please, think this over.
31380200 I see that you have reconsidered.
31380201 Thank goodness.
31400100 Ah, hello. You must be new here.
31400101 I'm...
31400102 Well, just call me Diallos.
31400103 The honor of one's house holds little import in these lands.
31400104 By the way, have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels?
31400105 She's my servant, but fickle as the wind.
31400106 Take your eyes off her for but a moment and she's good as gone.
31400107 If you find her, please be sure to tell me.
31400200 Be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman named Lanya.
31400201 She's a servant to my house.
31400202 She's been my companion since childhood.
31400203 I've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this.
31400204 Honestly, she's such a little tomboy.
31401000 Lanya... Lanya...
31401001 It's me, Diallos. Answer me, would you?
31401100 Hello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you.
31401101 The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends.
31401102 They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,
31401103 "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."
31401104 I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.
31401200 Ah, you again, is it?
31401201 The recusants sent a lackey.
31401202 Can you believe they invited me to join them?
31401203 I can scarcely believe it myself. Do they think me a fool?
31401204 You might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer.
31401205 Then I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout.
31401206 It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west
31401207 That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.
31401208 Just you wait, wretched recusants.
31401209 You'll rue the day you insulted my name by laying hands on Lanya.
31401210 "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.
31401300 Who on earth are you?
31401301 Hmph, never mind. But tell me if you know, would you.
31401302 The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends.
31401303 They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,
31401304 "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."
31401305 I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.
31401400 They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,
31401401 "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."
31401402 I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.
31401500 It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west
31401501 That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.
31401502 Just you wait, wretched recusants.
31401503 "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.
31402000 Ah. Oh... I-it's you, is it?
31402001 Well. Nice to see you again.
31402002 So you've been invited as well, I see.
31402003 Then we're comrades in arms, henceforth.
31402100 I, um, I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya...
31402101 Well, you see, I...
31402102 After much internal debate, I've come to realise...
31402103 Revenge is not the answer.
31402104 According to Lady Tanith...
31402105 I've got the stuff of champions.
31402106 And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced to walk a tainted path.
31402107 It hit me like a bolt from the blue...
31402108 That my former thoughts were simple naivet�.
31402109 Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya.
31402110 That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed.
31402111 But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't
31402112 Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both.
31402113 But such is true of any road trod by champions.
31402200 I always resented these hands.
31402201 Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow.
31402202 But that won't be the case for long.
31402203 They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions.
31402204 "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.
31403000 Ah, it's you, is it.
31403001 I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself?
31403002 I haven't achieved anything at all thus far.
31403003 Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again.
31403004 I'm still yet to achieve anything.
31403005 Perhaps I am a fool after all...
31403006 No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the
31403007 What an easy mark I must have been...
31403008 How did it take me so long to realise, honestly...
31403009 There's just no end to my foolishness, is there...
31403100 It's just as my noble brother says.
31403101 I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become
31403200 Perhaps I am a fool after all...
31403201 No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the
31403202 What an easy mark I must have been...
31404000 Well. Aren't you full of beans.
31404001 No wonder you're covered in muck.
31404100 Oh? My friend, it's been far too long.
31404101 I have to say you caught me at a rather low point.
31404102 But...as you see, I've put all that behind me.
31404103 Left the Volcano Manor. Forging my own path now.
31404104 Even a fool like me can look after some simple jars.
31404105 Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time
31404200 A fool I may be, but I can look after some simple jars.
31404201 Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time
31405100 ...Ah, you...
31405101 Are the jars...they alright?
31405102 Did I defend them?
31405200 Then all is well...
31405201 This fool proved his worth, in the end...
31405300 Ha...ha ha...
31405301 I see... I see...
31405302 I've been a fool...to the last...
31480000 Agh!
31480010 What on earth was that for!
31480100 Now I see. You're a wretched recusant!
31480101 May you rue the day that you thought to trample me!
31480102 The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood!
31480103 In blood!
31480200 Lanya, your honour has been restored.
31480201 As a charge of House Hoslow, you can rest easy.
31480300 Ha ha...ha...
31480301 I am the shame of House Hoslow after all...
31481000 Ugh!
31481010 What's the matter? Please, stop!
31481011 I've no quarrel with the Volcano Manor.
31481012 I will never brandish a sword again, I swear!
31481100 Why on earth...?
31481101 Wait, you're a poacher, aren't you?
31481102 I'll turn my back on duty no more.
31481103 The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood!
31481104 In blood!
31481200 Unharmed, thank the stars.
31481300 Ahh, just what I deserve...
31481301 For absconding from my duties...
31481302 I'm sorry, my dear jars...
31600100 Tarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here.
31600101 I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly.
31600102 Why are you here?
31600200 Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries?
31600201 Well, your aptitude does appear...passable.
31600202 But one must choose one's masters wisely.
31600203 I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria,
31600204 as a reviled, apostate witch.
31600205 Do you still wish to learn from me?
31600300 Well, you are a piece of work.
31600301 Very well. You are now my prot�g� in glintstone sorcery.
31600302 But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never.
31600303 Anticipate grievances, young apprentice.
31600400 Really.
31600401 It's not every day I meet a Tarnished just milling about.
31600500 What is it now? Why are you here again?
31600600 ...
31600601 You are quite the enigma, aren't you...
31600700 Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries?
31600701 I dare say your proclivities are far from ideal...
31600702 Oh well, perhaps nurture will defy nature, with a bit of luck.
31600703 But one must choose one's masters wisely.
31600704 I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria,
31600705 as a reviled, apostate witch.
31600706 Do you still wish to learn from me?
31600800 Yes, I think that would be wise.
31600801 We must choose our masters wisely.
31600900 Well? Have you made up your mind?
31601000 Young apprentice. First things first.
31601001 You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk.
31601002 So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance.
31601003 Now, shall we start learning?
31601100 There you are, my apprentice.
31601101 Shall we commence the lesson?
31601200 You wish to continue the lesson?
31601201 Very well, I have time aplenty.
31602000 Our art draws upon the powers embedded in glintstone.
31602001 But what is the nature of such power?
31602002 Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos.
31602003 Golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life, and houses its vitality,
31602004 while glintstone contains residual life, and thus the vitality of the stars.
31602005 It should not be forgotten,
31602006 that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.
31602007 A fact lost on most sorcerers, these days...
31602100 Your appetite for learning is impressive.
31602101 You make me proud. To have grown little legs so readily.
31602102 You must have a fabulous teacher.
31603000 Hmm? What's on your mind?
31603100 Well, well...
31603101 Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again...
31603102 But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge.
31603103 The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni.
31603104 But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles.
31603105 Now, he is the force that repulses the stars.
31603106 If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement.
31603107 And so, too, would Ranni's destiny.
31603110 Well, well...
31603111 Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again...
31603112 But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge.
31603113 The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni.
31603114 But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles.
31603115 Now, he is the force that repulses the stars.
31604000 My apprentice, what happened to your nail?
31604001 Perhaps you have a different view, but...
31604002 That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn.
31604003 May I remove it for you?
31604100 A wise choice. Let me neutralize it.
31604101 But first...
31604102 Listen up, wretched curse-peddler.
31604103 This is a vile craft in which you engage.
31604104 Let it be known.
31604105 This is the beloved apprentice of Sellen, Graven Witch.
31604106 I set a curse upon you and your meddling hand.
31604107 Your death will not be a pleasant one.
31604108 May you shudder between breaths in your sleep...
31604200 If you prefer not, that is your prerogative.
31604201 But let it be known.
31604202 That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn.
31604203 If what I have told you one day rings true,
31604204 by all means, come to me again.
31605000 What's this sorcery, my apprentice?
31605001 Ah, then you have seen Master Azur.
31605002 Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher.
31605003 A stern judge of men, but he must see something in you.
31605004 You make us both proud.
31605005 We can speak more later, my apprentice.
31606000 If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
31606001 It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.
31606002 The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care.
31606003 I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos.
31606004 No matter what we give in return.
31606005 My apprentice. I presume nothing.
31606006 Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path.
31606007 But hear me out, my apprentice.
31606008 I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.
31606009 Perhaps this is a journey we could take together?
31606100 Splendid. I thank you.
31606101 This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit.
31606102 You must have a fabulous teacher.
31606200 Forgive me, it was an outlandish idea to begin with.
31606201 And I fear quite presumptuous of me, as well.
31606202 Don't give it another thought, my apprentice.
31606300 Really? My apprentice.
31606301 You must have given this quite some thought.
31606302 Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me.
31606303 It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit.
31606400 There you are, my apprentice.
31606401 Shall we commence the lesson?
31606500 You wish to resume the lesson?
31606501 Indeed, that would be the wiser option.
31607000 I need your help, my apprentice.
31607001 Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer.
31607002 And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere.
31607003 My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat?
31607004 With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him.
31607100 I need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.
31607101 He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now...
31607200 After his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home.
31607201 A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds.
31607202 Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer.
31607203 It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby...
31608000 Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...
31608001 You have my gratitude. This is all your work.
31608002 I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit.
31608003 This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.
31608100 This brings us a full step closer.
31608101 The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy.
31608102 If only I could undo these wretched shackles...
31609000 My apprentice. Give me a moment later.
31609001 I have a favour to ask.
31609010 The form you see before you is merely a projection.
31609011 My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved.
31609012 My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between,
31609013 imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum.
31609014 Can you make the journey to my body?
31609015 I have something that I can only trust with you.
31609200 My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between,
31609201 imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum.
31609202 Can you make the journey to my body?
31609203 I have something that I can only trust with you.
31610000 My apprentice, thank you for coming.
31610001 These shackles take a toll on us all.
31610002 There is something I need you to look after.
31610003 My primal glintstone.
31610004 A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver.
31610005 Someone may come for my life. And so, I entrust it with you.
31610006 My self.
31610200 <groaning in pain>
31610201 <blank>
31610300 <panting>
31610301 <blank>
31610302 Thank you...my apprentice...
31610303 This...is my essence. Please, treat it with care.
31610400 <shivering moans>
31610401 <blank>
31610402 <blank>
31610403 It will do no good, I swear it...
31610404 ...and yet you persist, you frothing degenerates...
31610405 A...argh!
31610406 <shivering moans>
31610500 Treat it with care, my apprentice...
31610501 What you hold is my very being...
31611000 My apprentice, just how long has it been?
31611001 Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again.
31611002 And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone.
31611003 Better still, I've shed those awful shackles.
31611004 Finally, I can return to the academy.
31611005 To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current.
31611006 My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you.
31611100 Finally, I can return to the academy.
31611101 To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current.
31611200 My apprentice, shall we commence the lesson?
31611201 As thanks for procuring this new form, I'll be holding you to a higher standard.
31611300 You wish to resume the lesson?
31611301 Have I not been strict enough, I wonder?
31612000 Ahh, my apprentice.
31612001 You've saved my skin once again.
31612002 Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more.
31612003 With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current.
31612004 So that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again.
31612005 My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?
31612006 Oh, I know it's not possible.
31612007 You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord.
31612008 But do think of me.
31612009 Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning.
31612010 You will always be my darling pupil.
31612011 Rest assured that I...
31612012 No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch.
31612013 My apprentice. Become Elden Lord.
31612100 Hmm, perhaps I'm jumping ahead,
31612101 but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's.
31612200 Do you recall what once I told you?
31612201 That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.
31612202 When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me.
31612203 Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring.
31612204 Next time, I will be your student.
31612300 Oh, one last thing.
31612301 If you fail to claim your throne,
31612302 you can always pay me a visit.
31612303 Oh, don't fret. Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here.
31612400 Ahh, my apprentice.
31612401 You've saved my skin once again.
31612402 Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more.
31612403 With the body of Master Azur returned, the academy can restore the primeval current.
31612404 So that we, fallen children of the stars, might beam with brilliance once again.
31612405 My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?
31612406 Oh, I know it's not possible.
31612407 You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord.
31612408 But do think of me.
31612409 Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning.
31612410 You will always be my darling pupil.
31612411 Rest assured that I...
31612412 No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch.
31612413 My apprentice. Become Elden Lord.
31612500 What is it? My apprentice.
31612600 Ahh, I am glad to see you. My apprentice.
31612601 Would you like a lesson? I'm always glad to further your education.
31612700 It warms my heart. That you still think of me.
31612701 Yet I still yearn, for you to find Master Lusat.
31612702 His body is needed. At the academy, to hone the primeval current...
31612800 Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...
31612801 Oh, this is wonderful news. Now, his body will be brought home.
31612802 And when the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat are together, the academy can hone the primeval current.
31612803 So that we, fallen children of the stars, will beam once again.
31612804 I am most grateful. There are no others who would have done this.
31612805 What a joy to have you as an apprentice, and kindred spirit.
31612806 This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.
31612900 You wish to resume the lesson?
31612901 Good. Indeed, it is better to finish what one starts, is it not?
31613000 Jerren, bringer of my death.
31613001 You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles.
31613002 But I am afraid your work is done.
31613003 Join the school. To reflect on your mistake.
31614000 U...urgh
31614001 M-my...apprentice...
31614002 I-I'm...
31614100 My...apprentice...
31615000 Oh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days.
31615001 Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar.
31615002 I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons.
31615003 Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice.
31680000 What's the meaning of this?
31680100 How unfortunate.
31680101 That we should part ways in this manner...
31680110 How unfortunate.
31680200 Ngh!
31680300 Why, you. Are you mad?
31680400 My death would only be temporary.
31680401 Your savagery achieves nothing.
31680500 Agh!
31680600 Why, you. Are you mad?
31680601 Another moment of this, and no amount of grovelling will spare you.
31680700 You sadden me, my apprentice.
31680800 Ahh, how can this be...
31680801 ...every fallen child... must shine again...
31680900 For a time, I believed us kindred spirits.
31680901 My apprentice...
31690000 <blank>
31690001 <blank>
31690002 <blank>
31800100 If it isn't Nerijus. The Bloody Finger.
31800101 The end is nigh. For you, and your cessblood.
31801000 Just joining the fray, Tarnished?
31801001 Well, you fought Nerijus and survived. That alone deserves commendation.
31801002 I am Yura. Hunter of Bloody Fingers.
31801003 Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.
31801004 If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.
31801005 Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
31801006 Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
31801010 Just joining the fray, Tarnished?
31801011 Well, you fought Nerijus and made good your escape. Fortune favours you, it seems.
31801012 I am Yura. Hunter of Bloody Fingers.
31801013 Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.
31801014 If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.
31801015 Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
31801016 Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
31801100 Oh, one other thing...
31801101 There are other Tarnished, like me, who hunt the Bloody Fingers.
31801102 If a Bloody Finger threatens you, use this ring.
31801103 If fortune takes your side, a hunter will come to your aid.
31801300 Just joining the fray, Tarnished?
31801301 I am Yura, hunter of Bloody Fingers.
31801302 Have you ever faced a Bloody Finger?
31801303 They are Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.
31801304 If you stay the path, you will face this blight, sooner or later.
31801305 Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
31801306 Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
31801500 One last word of warning.
31801501 Stay clear of Agheel Lake. A great dragon roosts there.
31801502 And it's as fearsome as it is majestic.
31801503 So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...
31801504 stay clear of the lake.
31801600 Be on your way.
31801601 Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.
31802000 Well, we meet again.
31802001 Beware. A great dragon roosts at Agheel Lake.
31802002 And it's as fearsome as it is majestic.
31802003 So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...
31802004 stay clear of the lake.
31802100 Hmm, I gave you fair warning.
31802101 To stay clear of Agheel Lake, a known dragon roost.
31802102 Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.
31802200 Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.
31802300 Ah, we meet again.
31802301 To have fought Nerijus and lived, you must have seen your share of battle.
31802302 I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers.
31802303 Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.
31802304 If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.
31802305 Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
31802306 Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
31802310 Ah, we meet again.
31802311 To have fought Nerijus and escaped, fortune must smile upon you indeed.
31802312 I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers.
31802313 Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.
31802314 If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.
31802315 Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
31802316 Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
31802400 Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.
31802401 You'd do well to steer clear of Agheel Lake, fledgling. A dragon roosts there...
31802402 And it's as fearsome as it is majestic.
31802403 So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...
31802404 stay clear of the lake.
31802500 You bloody halfwit.
31802501 Picking a fight with a dragon?
31802502 Well, I can tell you want to see it through.
31802503 Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you.
31802600 Ah, we meet again.
31802601 I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers.
31802602 Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.
31802603 If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.
31802604 Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
31802605 Don't let your emotions stay your blade.
31802700 Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.
31802701 And quite the fool, by the look of it.
31802702 Picking a fight with a dragon? Hah.
31802703 Well, I can tell you want to see it through.
31802704 Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you.
31802800 I can tell you want to see it through.
31802801 Fools will be fools. Fight all the dragons you like.
31803000 There you are. That was my first dragon hunt in quite some time.
31803001 Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times.
31803002 Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know.
31803003 That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.
31803004 If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,
31803005 then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.
31803100 You must not forget, though.
31803101 Those who partake in Dragon Communion will one day shed their humanity.
31803102 Their hunger for dragon, their yearning, only worsens.
31803103 Until the floodgates burst, unleashing eternal torment.
31803104 The strength of a mighty dragon. Magnificent, but deadly.
31803105 It's no surprise that Dragon Communion is ruinous.
31803200 Beautiful work, felling that dragon.
31803201 And as such, there's something you might like to know.
31803202 That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.
31803203 If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,
31803204 then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.
31803300 ...
31803301 Wretched worms, leave me be...
31803302 <blank>
31803400 Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.
31803401 That was my first dragon hunt in quite a while.
31803402 Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times.
31803403 Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know.
31803404 The heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.
31803405 If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,
31803406 then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.
31803500 Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.
31803501 Beautiful work, felling that dragon.
31803502 And as such, there's something you might like to know.
31803503 That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.
31803504 If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,
31803505 then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.
31804000 Ah, oh, it's you. Thanks for your help there.
31804001 That Bloody Finger was a thorn in my side. And now I'm finally rid of him.
31804002 Here's a token of thanks. Please, take it.
31804100 I may not have much time.
31804101 I'm dying to see you, Eleonora... Violet Bloody Finger...
31804200 Yes, I've been tracking Eleonora for quite some time.
31804201 She is the deadliest of all Bloody Fingers. She's felled many an old hand already.
31804202 But in spite of her cessblood zealotry, Eleonora is a proud knight.
31804203 If she comes for you, do not think twice. You must flee.
31804204 There is no shame in self-preservation.
31804300 Be on your way.
31804301 Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.
31807000 Eleonora, it seems I am no match for you.
31807001 But I've learned a thing or two myself, you see.
31807002 I've sliced the finger off.
31807003 Please, please, Eleonora, yield to the cessblood no longer.
31807004 Do not stain the immaculacy of your sword, your flesh, your fire...
31808000 Finally, we meet.
31808001 The Tarnished, who would be Lord.
31808002 Oh my, why the long face?
31808003 I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel.
31808004 Well, that is most unfortunate. For he is dead.
31808005 As for his flesh, he gave it to me, Shabriri.
31808006 I hope you can make your peace with that.
31808100 You are about to sacrifice something precious.
31808101 The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge.
31808102 Only so that you may be Lord.
31808103 What a horrible thing to ponder.
31808104 Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not.
31808105 But how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon?
31808200 Chosen Tarnished and would-be Lord, dare to tread the path of true rigor.
31808201 Spare the poor girl, and singe your own flesh in her stead.
31808202 If you are prepared to show resolve,
31808203 and attain Lordship through righteous hardship,
31808204 then heed the words of I, Shabriri.
31808300 Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord.
31808301 Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital.
31808302 Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy.
31808303 If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling,
31808304 and the girl can be spared.
31808305 ...setting you on the righteous path of lordship.
31808306 The path of the Lord of Chaos.
31808307 Burn the Erdtree to the ground,
31808308 and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.
31808309 Ahh, may chaos take the world!
31808310 May chaos take the world!
31808400 Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord.
31808401 Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital.
31808402 Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy.
31808500 Burn the Erdtree to the ground,
31808501 and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.
31808502 Ahh, may chaos take the world!
31808503 May chaos take the world!
31880000 Ugh.
31880100 That will be quite enough.
31880101 What do you stand to gain by challenging me?
31880200 Too late for you, eh?
31880201 Well, if you've succumbed to cessblood...
31880202 it's better that I finish you here.
31880300 I had no choice.
31880301 Your death could have been much worse.
31880400 What a wretched fate.
31880401 Why did you turn foul...
31880500 I must not die...
31880501 until she is eradicated...
31882000 What's this?
31882100 Well, this is peculiar.
31882101 Is this how you express contempt?
31882200 This, I did not expect.
31882201 But if you do not care for Lordship,
31882202 I'm afraid you are of no use.
31882300 How very unfortunate.
31882301 I did not take you for a fraud.
31882400 Shabriri is chaos incarnate. I cannot die.
31882401 Ahh, may chaos take the world!
31900100 There's no mistake, is there?
31900101 Death has left its mark once again.
31900110 I'm sorry, I cannot give you your proper rites...
31900111 But at least you did not join Those Who Live in Death.
31900112 Your soul will return to the Erdtree, in time.
31900113 Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit.
31900200 Ah, a Tarnished, are you?
31900201 I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.
31900202 Heed my warning.
31900203 The village here has been touched by Death.
31900204 And worse yet, it is home to a mariner.
31900205 If you value your life, then go no further.
31900300 The village here has been touched by Death.
31900301 Turn back, while you still can.
31901000 Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh?
31901001 But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot.
31901002 ...
31901003 How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?
31901004 If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,
31901005 then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
31901006 I have a matter of my own to attend to.
31901007 And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.
31901008 What say you?
31901100 Very well. Show me your map.
31901101 ...
31901102 I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway.
31901103 It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
31901200 I have a matter of my own to attend to.
31901201 I spotted the mark of the centipede here in the village.
31901202 An ill-omened symbol that should not be.
31901203 Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order.
31901204 And must be eradicated.
31901300 What is it? Still milling about?
31901301 The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.
31901302 It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
31901400 Well, all right, then.
31901401 No sense in forcing you.
31901500 What now? Had a change of heart?
31901600 Ah, a Tarnished, are you?
31901601 With a prowess for weeding Deathroot.
31901602 ...
31901603 I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.
31901604 How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?
31901605 If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,
31901606 then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
31901607 I have a matter of my own to attend to.
31901608 And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.
31902000 Ha! Prince of Death, take a good long look!
31902001 See the wrath of the Golden Order! The Order's justice, writ in blood!
31902002 This is what's become of your precious witch! Naught but expired meat and bone!
31902003 This is a proper death, O Prince!
31902004 Look at this rotten whore. No more children can be got from this useless flesh!
31902005 Behold, your mother is dead!
31902006 Heh heh heh heh...
31902007 This is revenge, you witch! And you, you ghoul! This is the wrath of D!
31902100 Ah. Hello.
31902101 The rotten witch is dead. The Golden Order, unsullied.
31902102 Now I can look my brother Darian in the eye.
31902103 Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit.
31902200 Darian, now I have no regrets.
31902201 Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit.
31903000 <sleeping>
31903100 Ah, aah...
31903101 D-da...ri...
31903102 Ngh...nnngh...
31903300 Soon you will know... Vengeance for Darian.
31903301 The wrath of D...
31912000 I don't believe we've met.
31912001 I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.
31912002 Heed my warning.
31912003 Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.
31912004 All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number.
31912005 Unless you wish to lay down your life in vain.
31912100 Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.
31912101 All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number.
31912200 Ah...we meet again.
31912201 I'm glad you took my warning to heart.
31912202 Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.
31912203 All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number.
31913000 Well, well...
31913001 With a prowess for weeding Deathroot.
31913002 ...
31913003 How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?
31913004 If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,
31913005 then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
31913006 I have a matter of my own to attend to.
31913007 And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.
31913008 What say you?
31913050 Well, well...
31913051 Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh?
31913052 But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot.
31913053 ...
31913054 How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?
31913055 If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,
31913056 then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
31913057 I have a matter of my own to attend to.
31913058 And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.
31913059 What say you?
31913100 Very well. Show me your map.
31913101 ...
31913102 I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway.
31913103 It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
31913200 I have a matter of my own to attend to.
31913201 I've spotted the mark of the centipede.
31913202 An ill-omened symbol that should not be.
31913203 Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order.
31913204 And must be eradicated.
31913300 What is it? Still milling about?
31913301 The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.
31913302 It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
31913400 Well, all right, then.
31913401 No sense in forcing you.
31913500 What's wrong? Got cold feet, have you?
31914000 You've met Gurranq, I take it?
31914001 Then owing to our duties shared, we are now comrades-in-arms.
31914002 I think you've earned this.
31914003 The power of the Golden Order, to aid the hunt of Those Who Live in Death.
31914100 Did you need something else?
31914200 Ah, hello there. What can I do for you?
31914300 Ah, hello. You've been busy weeding Deathroot, I take it.
31914301 I thank you, as your brother-in-arms.
31914302 So what can I do for you?
31914400 Ah, hello again.
31914401 You haven't gone to see Gurranq yet, have you?
31914402 Well, no rush. You do as you please.
31914403 Just as long as he doesn't starve to death, eh.
31914500 Go to Gurranq only if you feel the time is right.
31914501 Killing Those Who Live in Death and weeding their Deathroot...
31914502 Is a path not to be trod without ample resolve.
31915000 I serve the Golden Order.
31915001 That I might put this crooked land to rights.
31915002 Following only the guidance of the great Elden Ring.
31915003 Those Who Live in Death fall outside the principles of the Golden Order.
31915004 Their mere existence sullies the guidance of gold. Tainting its truth.
31915005 And so it is the vermin must be exterminated... Down to the very last.
31915100 Are you acquainted with a man named Rogier?
31915101 You know, the piteous fellow hiding away on the balcony?
31915102 He was a formidable spellblade, in times past.
31915103 Don't let his easy air deceive you. He was wise beyond his years, stout of heart and clear of mind.
31915104 No more though.
31915105 You see him now, ravaged by thorns, muttering and rambling...
31915106 Like he's half dead already. I can't stomach to watch.
31915107 Take well the lesson, friend.
31915108 That's how you end up, when seduced by Those Who Live in Death.
31915109 When grace is sullied, it rots people from the inside. Breaks them.
31915200 Well, what have we here?
31915201 How did you get your hands on that dagger?
31915202 ...
31915203 Well. That hardly matters.
31915204 I know very well whose dagger it is.
31915205 Why don't I return it to them for you?
31915206 Good work, bringing this to me.
31915300 Ah, hello there. What can I do for you?
31915400 Ah, hello there. What can I do for you?
31915500 Ah, hello there. What can I do for you?
31915501 The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.
31915502 It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.
31915600 Did you need something else?
31980000 <wince>
31980010 Don't you dare.
31980011 Unless you want to die like a dog?
31980100 Very well.
31980101 Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit.
31980200 I swear, there's a blight spreading amongst the Tarnished.
31980300 How could this...happen...?
31980301 Forgive me, Devin... D-Devin...
31981000 Oof!
31981010 What's the meaning of this?
31981011 Has she bewitched you?
31981100 Very well.
31981101 Then you are a blight.
31981102 A defiler of the Golden Order, and murderer of my brother!
31981103 Die! Die! Die!
31981104 I'll grind your corpse into that vile wench's rotting remains.
31981105 A witch's eternal embrace, just as you wished!
31981200 You defiled cretin. My brother is now avenged!
31981300 How could this...
31981301 Forgive me, Darian... D-Darian...
32000100 Everyone's...been grafted.
32000101 Everyone who came with me. They crossed the sea for me. They fought, for me.
32000102 Heh...
32000103 Only to have their arms taken. Their legs taken. Even their heads...taken.
32000104 Did you know? If you're grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid.
32000105 It's quite the lark, when you think about it.
32000200 You're all on your own, are you?
32000201 And heading to Stormveil Castle?
32000202 Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose. Oh, you've come to be one with the spider?
32000203 Well, that makes us two peas in a pod.
32000204 But I don't have your courage.
32000205 It's scary, you know. Having your arms cut off. Or legs. Or your head.
32000206 I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just too scared.
32000207 I'm nothing but a craven.
32000300 Oh, I know.
32000301 Can you take this little one along with you?
32000310 The poor thing deserves someone braver than myself�
32000311 And the spirits look rather fondly upon you.
32000312 It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.
32000500 It was a pleasure to see you.
32000501 Oh, can you pass on a message for me, if you see the little chrysalids in Stormveil Castle?
32000502 Tell them I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.
32000503 I'm finally getting the hang of this whole "pain" thing, you know.
32001300 What's this?
32001301 A keepsake? From my men?
32001302 Oh, goodness me�
32001303 I can't�
32001304 ...
32001400 A pleasure to see you.
32001401 Did you give the little chrysalids the message?
32001402 That I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.
32002000 They all...believed in me.
32002001 They all thought I'd make something of myself. Me! Who can't do anything...
32002002 I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold.
32002003 Perhaps I'll find my purpose there.
32002100 I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold.
32002101 Perhaps I'll find my purpose there.
32003000 Greetings. Nice to see you again.
32003001 My name is Roderika. I should have told you sooner.
32003002 Isn't this place impressive, though?
32003003 The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.
32003004 I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.
32003005 Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth.
32003006 I'm still looking for my own purpose.
32003200 You're telling me I possess some kind of gift?
32003201 I don't believe you. But...
32003202 If I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first...
32003203 I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I?
32003204 I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.
32003205 Certainly, he does appear intimidating, and holds no love for us Tarnished...
32003206 But I know he's trapped here, at the Roundtable Hold... So...
32003207 I can tell. He's a gentle soul, underneath it all.
32003300 Oh, and�
32003301 Please, allow to me to express my thanks.
32003302 For giving me that keepsake from my men.
32003303 It was as if I was frozen with self-pity. I failed them at every turn.
32003304 You have my gratitude. Please, take this.
32003400 A pleasure to meet you.
32003401 My name is Roderika. I'm a recent arrival.
32003402 Isn't this place impressive?
32003403 The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.
32003404 I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.
32003405 Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth.
32003406 I'm still looking for my own purpose.
32003500 It's all a bit much for me, in truth.
32003501 I'm still looking for my own purpose.
32003600 A pleasure to see you.
32003601 Thank goodness you're safe.
32003602 I'm still looking for my own purpose.
32003603 It's not easy, by any means, but it's what I must do.
32003700 If I do have a talent for spirit tuning, and goodness knows that would be a surprise�
32003701 I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I?
32003702 I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.
32004000 Good to see you again. Thank you very much!
32004001 I have you to thank, don't I? For persuading Master Hewg?
32004002 I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning.
32004003 I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish,
32004004 but if I might be any help to you all, I'd certainly like to try.
32004005 And if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted...
32004006 Well, I certainly must try.
32004007 Roderika the spirit tuner prentice. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
32005000 Greetings.
32005001 Are you here for spirit tuning?
32005100 I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late.
32005101 I can see how and why immortal essence exists as spirit under the Golden Order.
32005102 I can understand their yearnings, what they become drawn to...
32005103 Master Hewg said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere prentice any longer.
32005104 Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Roderika the certified spirit tuner.
32005200 I'd like to ask you a small favour.
32005201 Can you take this little one along with you?
32005202 They can't be summoned here.
32005203 But the spirits look rather fondly upon you.
32005204 It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.
32005300 I need to warn you about something.
32005301 A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable.
32005302 And I can hear, from all the way over there...
32005303 The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...
32005304 A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony...
32005305 I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls...
32005306 Not even the grafting caused anything like this to happen...
32005307 You should keep your distance.
32005308 I know you're strong, but please...
32005400 I can hear it from across the wing, past the roundtable...
32005401 The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of the curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...
32005402 You should keep your distance.
32005403 I know you're strong, but please...
32005500 I can't hear them any more, the voices of the spirits cowering from the curse...
32005501 I suppose the Dung Eater must have left the Roundtable.
32005502 I just pray nothing ill comes of this.
32005600 Be on your guard, I beg you.
32005601 He's back. The Dung Eater. Again.
32005602 I can hear them, the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse.
32005603 And worse than ever, the reverberations of the twisted malison itself.
32005604 But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now.
32005605 I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order.
32005700 The voices of the tormented spirits are silent again..
32005701 But it isn't like last time.
32005702 I'm almost certain...the spirits have escaped their confinement.
32005703 Did you...have anything to do with it, I wonder?
32006000 Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground.
32006001 Don't worry, I don't blame you.
32006002 I'll continue spirit tuning just the same as before.
32006003 Which is why I need your help persuading Master Hewg to leave.
32006004 His roots are so knotted in this place.
32006005 He won't last much longer if he stays here...
32006006 His shackles are broken. He's a free man, now.
32006007 It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him.
32006100 I see. You're here for some spirit tuning?
32007000 Oh, is that right...
32007001 So Master Hewg won't listen to you, either.
32007002 You have my thanks, regardless.
32007003 I'll try and talk him round next time.
32007004 I know he was given this great entreaty,
32007005 To craft a weapon which could slay a god. Though I can't help but think of it as a curse.
32007006 A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika.
32007007 And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do...
32008000 Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to...
32008001 To think he'd forget who you were, as well.
32008002 I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg.
32008003 I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now.
32008004 But maybe it's better that we don't.
32008005 It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay.
32008100 I'll remain with Hewg.
32008101 He made me who I am today.
32008102 I'd like to return the kindness, in whatever small way I can.
32008200 Please, become Elden Lord.
32008201 Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him.
32008202 So slay her, with the weapons he smithed.
32008203 Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all.
32080000 You're willing to make me a chrysalid?
32080001 Ah, but I'm still a milksop craven...
32080002 I can't even govern myself to step beyond the bounds of this ward...
32080003 Please. You're only wasting your strength.
32080300 I know how you must feel.
32080301 But please, I'm not ready.
32080302 Or are you like me? You're so far out of your mind with fear...
32080303 You've divested yourself of all reason?
32080500 Please, stop.
32080501 Even if you persist, your fear will not abate.
32100100 Hello? Is anybody there?
32100101 Someone who might be interested in rescuing the great Kenneth Haight?
32100102 Servant to the true Order, and celebrated repudiator of the false!
32100103 O Erdtree! Grant me succour!
32101000 Ah, you've come to lend me your aid, have you?
32101001 Well, that's very kind, but, um...
32101002 No, no. Th-the help is very much appreciated. Even from a Tarnished.
32101003 Despite appearances, nobility is no prerequisite to serving the true Order.
32101004 You might have heard of me. Kenneth Haight. Next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave.
32101005 Young Tarnished, I would have a boon of you.
32101006 I want you to take back my fort. It lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood.
32101007 A Knight commander from Stormveil took it. A fool, and plumb mad to boot. Simply obsessed with blood!
32101100 What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye?
32101101 My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me.
32101102 Oh I see. You wish to know the reward?
32101103 Fret not, the great Kenneth Haight is known for his considerable largesse.
32101104 The celebrations will be lavish indeed, upon the dawn of my fort's retrieval.
32101200 Hmph, yes, now allow me to furnish you with a little advice.
32101201 I would take great care to avoid Godrick's Tarnished hunts, were I in your shoes.
32101202 That depraved lot are obsessed with sacrificing Tarnished like you for the sake of "grafting".
32101203 Honestly, Godrick's nothing more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don't make me laugh.
32101204 First he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from Radahn in that castle...
32101205 Then he insulted Malenia, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man.
32101206 Has he no shame, the big girl's blouse?
32101207 And to think, he's the blood of Godfrey! Last of the golden lineage, though you almost wouldn't know it to look at him.
32101208 I almost feel sorry for the chap the more I think of it.
32101300 What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye?
32101301 My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me.
32101400 Hm? What's this, kind sir?
32101401 Remarkable! The Knight Commander, dead. Already!
32101402 A blessing, if ever I chanced upon one.
32101403 Fine work, I say, fine work, indeed.
32101404 I doubt that it was your intention, but the deed is done, and I commend you.
32101405 Now, this is your reward.
32101406 Go on, it is yours, for the keeping.
32102000 Ah-ha! I've been waiting for you with baited breath!
32102001 Did you manage to recapture my fort?
32102002 Oh excellent news, just wonderful. And the knight's dead to boot!
32102003 Well done my friend, well done indeed!
32102004 I knew I was right to trust you!
32102005 Now, here's your reward, as promised.
32102006 Go ahead, it's all yours.
32102100 Right then. Time for me to head to the fort.
32102101 I've much to do. First I'll have to reestablish communication with the demi-humans.
32102102 What's that look? You don't believe me?
32102103 Well, under the Erdtree, commingling with the demi-humans is made possible.
32102104 Even the vulgar shall not be left behind, under the rule of true Order.
32102105 Which is why I, Kenneth Haight, next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave, have sworn to uphold it.
32102106 Just you watch, my friend. Just you watch.
32102110 Right then. Time for me to head to the fort.
32102111 I've much to do. First I'll have to reestablish communication with the demi-humans.
32102200 Ah, yes. I've been meaning to ask.
32102201 Would you like to enter my service?
32102202 I see bright things in your future, stout warrior.
32102203 Enter into my service and learn the workings of the Erdtree's true Order.
32102204 And who knows, perhaps some time down the line, the grace of gold will return to those Tarnished eyes of yours.
32102205 What say you? A fine accord, is it not?
32102300 Very well. Very well, indeed.
32102301 I knew I saw something in you.
32102302 I shall await you at my fort.
32102303 We shall hold the ceremony for your knighting there, I think.
32102304 I see great things ahead of us. We are truly by the Erdtree blessed.
32102400 Excuse me?
32102401 Such foolishness have I never seen!
32102402 Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice.
32102403 Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself.
32102404 Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort.
32102500 What is it? Have you put your misgivings to rest?
32102600 Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice.
32102601 Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself.
32102602 Oh don't fret, there's no hurry.
32102603 Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort.
32104000 Why...
32104001 Why the queen... Now all hope is...
32104002 (dies)
32105000 Ah, you, is it?
32105001 I suppose you must have seen it by now, yes, the sorry state of my fort?
32105002 Oh, indeed, it is a foul fate for a land, to be without a ruler.
32105003 One must be found, with haste. And not that awful Godrick.
32105004 But a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.
32105100 I am sorry to have lifted your hopes...
32105101 But I haven't the authority to raise you to knighthood as things stand.
32105102 The great Kenneth Haight issues his sincerest apology.
32105103 But now, I must begin my search post-haste.
32105104 For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.
32105200 I must begin my search post-haste.
32105201 For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.
32106000 Ah, nice to see you after so long.
32106001 Safe and sound, I take it, yes? Good.
32106002 Ah, quite. I have indeed selected a new ruler.
32106003 Lady Nepheli is strong and just. Worthy of the burden of Limgrave's lineage.
32106004 Such is the sincere opinion of I, Kenneth Haight, no less.
32106005 For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.
32106006 At which time I can fulfil my old promise.
32106007 By raising you to the glory of knighthood.
32106008 I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.
32106100 For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.
32106101 At which time I can fulfil my old promise.
32106102 By raising you to the glory of knighthood.
32106103 I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.
32180000 Oof!
32180100 Goodness gracious!
32180101 Calm yourself, this instant!
32180102 Enough! This is madness!
32180200 Blast! You wretched Tarnished!
32180201 I am Kenneth Haight, and I have seen quite enough!
32180300 I fear for the integrity of the Order...
32180400 Where are my...men...?
32180401 O Erdtree, why have you forsaken me...?
32200100 Greetings, great champion called by grace.
32200101 I am Fia.
32200102 Circumstances have compelled my stay at the Roundtable Hold.
32200103 Great champion, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly?
32200104 Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigour, and your stout-heartedness.
32200105 Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion.
32200106 And you, I am sure, will bear a baldachin's blessing.
32200107 Do you think it vulgar, perhaps?
32200108 Where I come from, it is a sacred act.
32200200 Ah, my thanks, great champion.
32200210 You are...very warm...
32200220 What you felt light up inside you was a baldachin's blessing.
32200221 Though it is but a fleeting thing, I am afraid.
32200222 Come back to me, should you require another.
32200223 I will take you in my arms as often as you need.
32200300 I understand.
32200301 Your disdain is only natural.
32200302 But should you change your mind...
32200303 Come pay me another visit.
32200400 Oh, my dear...
32200401 Had a change of heart already?
32200500 I am pleased to see you again.
32200501 Would you like me to hold you, once more?
32200502 The blessing is still aflame in your breast, dear.
32200503 Would you like to be held, regardless?
32200550 I am pleased to see you again.
32200551 Would you like me to hold you, once more?
32200600 Now, come closer...
32200610 You are so...very warm...
32200700 Then good day to you, my dear.
32202000 I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from.
32202001 After I received the warmth and lifely vigour from a number of champions,
32202002 I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life.
32202003 To do so is the purpose of my being.
32202004 But before I could bear the noble into new life,
32202005 I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace.
32202006 Pray, be kind.
32202007 Despite all that, I still wish to be a Deathbed Companion.
32202008 So please, let me hold you like this, as often as it takes.
32202100 My dear...
32202101 Might I ask something of you?
32202102 Could you please find the owner of this dagger, and return it to them?
32202110 A certain person gave it to me, as a gift.
32202111 It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.
32202112 So I would like for the original owner to have it back, if you wouldn't mind.
32202200 I'd like you to find the owner of the dagger I gave you, and return it to them.
32202201 It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.
32202300 My dear...
32202301 Have you ever heard of black knifeprints?
32202302 Dear Rogier likes to talk of them when abed.
32202303 And the ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain.
32202304 The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act,
32202305 along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy.
32202306 These grand affairs are hardly my fort�...
32202307 But dear Rogier began to weep as he spoke...
32202400 Dear Rogier likes to talk of it when abed.
32202401 The ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain.
32202402 The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act,
32202403 along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy.
32202500 I heard that you lent a hand to dear Rogier.
32202501 He seemed positively elated.
32202502 He must be possessed of great mental fortitude.
32202503 It anchors his will, and sustains him, despite his grievous wounds.
32202504 You truly are a champion.
32202505 To dear Rogier, and myself, too.
32202600 <blank>
32202601 <blank>
32202602 <blank>
32202603 <blank>
32202700 In truth I've heard tell from someone else,
32202701 about the black knifeprints that fascinate dear Rogier so.
32202750 But It wouldn't be right to give this to him, stuck as he is in the Roundtable Hold.
32202751 Perhaps you could make use of it?
32203000 Finally, it is returned to its rightful place.
32203001 The stolen hallowbrand, of the exalted noble.
32203002 And now, I must bid you goodbye as well.
32203003 Though I ask you deliver this message to the Roundtable Hold.
32203004 I am Fia, Deathbed Companion.
32203005 Hark, Roundtable. Disturb not the Death of Godwyn, the exalted.
32203006 We, who humbly live in Death...
32203007 Live in waiting, to one day welcome our Lord.
32203008 What right does anyone have to object?
32203009 Our Lord will rise. The Lord of the many, and the meek.
32204000 Ah...there you are.
32204001 I knew you would come.
32204002 What is it you intend?
32204003 To deny us, and our ways?
32204004 Like the dogmatic brutes of the Golden Order?
32204100 I see. Then you must kill me.
32204101 For I am the companion of Godwyn, Prince of Death.
32204102 I wished to be a mother to Those Who Live in Death.
32204103 So it is, that any loathing, any hatred that overshadows them...
32204104 I must bear, as a matter of duty, with my own flesh.
32204200 Go on, kill me.
32204201 You deny us, do you not?
32204202 Because we deign to live in Death, and wish our Lord to rise to glory.
32204300 You are an odd one.
32204301 I am the guardian of Those Who Live in Death.
32204302 They call me a foul and rotten witch.
32204303 Yet you still wish to be held by me?
32204400 I will soon lay with Godwyn.
32204401 And it will surely stir within me.
32204402 the new life of the golden prince, and first Dead of the demigods,
32204403 as the rune of Those Who Live in Death.
32204404 Please, do one thing for me.
32204405 Brandish this child, my rune, and take for yourself the throne.
32204406 Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death.
32204407 By becoming our Elden Lord.
32204500 I will soon lay with Godwyn.
32204501 To conceive my child, the rune.
32204502 Brandish my rune, and take for yourself the throne.
32204503 Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death.
32204504 By becoming our Elden Lord.
32204600 This is goodbye, my dear.
32204601 But I am satisfied.
32204602 I choose to lie with Godwyn of my own will. Not the remains of one chosen for me.
32204603 And I will bear a child.
32204604 Who will inherit your warmth, too.
32204605 What greater blessing could there be, but to be born a Deathbed Companion?

32205003 <blank>
32205100 Have you ever seen a hallowbrand?
32205101 When the first of the demigods died, his flesh was marked with the half-wheel wound of the centipede.
32205102 Godwyn's hallowbrand has since been recovered at the Roundtable Hold.
32205103 But there is another hallowbrand out there somewhere.
32205104 And I must find it.
32205105 Before the time comes we receive our Lord.
32205200 When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh.
32205201 But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede.
32205202 And I must find it.
32205203 Before the time comes we receive our Lord.
32205204 My hands will be dirtied once more by the deed.
32205205 Will you still let me hold you, even then?
32205300 When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh.
32205301 But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede.
32205302 And I must find it.
32205303 Before the time comes we receive our Lord.
32205400 This...is the other hallowbrand.
32205401 How did you...
32205402 Oh, my utmost thanks.
32205403 With this, Godwyn can take his rightful place as First of the Dead.
32205404 And claim a second, illustrious life.
32205405 You are my-- our true champion.
32205406 And though I can't be of any use to you...
32205407 Can I hold you tight, if only for a moment?
32280000 Godwyn...
32280001 Is that you, dear?
32280100 Will your kind never stop?
32280101 Ravaging...the weak?
32290000 <blank>
32290010 <blank>
32300100 Have you ever felt the curse, with your whole being?
32300101 The pox upon life itself, feared and despised by all. The reviled blessing.
32300102 ...
32300103 Apparently not.
32300104 You are but a lamb. A stranger to defilement. Ignorant of your own ignorance.
32300105 You no longer interest me.
32300106 I've been long without peace. Don't spoil my quietude.
32300200 I asked you not to disturb me.
32300201 Be thankful of the Hold's serenity.
32300202 It is all that keeps your death and defilement at bay.
32301000 No, wait.
32301001 ...
32301002 You have felt the curse.
32301003 I can smell it on you. The pox, yet tender.
32301004 Apparently my seedbed is ripe and waiting.
32301005 Twas a brief respite, I must say.
32301006 Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh.
32301007 Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital.
32301010 I can kill you, and defile your corpse.
32301011 Then the pox will truly be your own.
32301100 Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh.
32301101 Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital.
32301102 I can kill you, and defile your corpse.
32301103 Then the pox will truly be your own.
32302000 ...
32302001 Let me out! Let me out of here!
32302002 Must eat more! Defile more!
32302003 Everything that matters to you!
32302004 For generations to come!
32302005 I am the Dung Eater!
32302006 A scourge upon the living!
32302100 Who are you?
32302200 I've been here long enough.
32302201 I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care.
32302202 Just to be sure. That when they're reborn�
32302203 They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come�
32302300 I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care.
32302301 Just to be sure. That when they're reborn�
32302302 They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come�
32302400 I am the Dung Eater.
32302401 A scourge upon the living.
32302402 I must eat more. Defile more...
32302500 Let me out. Let me out of here.
32303000 I will kill you, and defile your corpse.
32303001 Then the pox will truly be your own.
32303100 I'll give you a good blessing.
32303101 You'll be nourishment for the pox.
32304000 There you are.
32304001 You warded off my blessing.
32304002 Despite the curse stirring within you.
32304003 No one has succeeded in that before.
32304004 How? I thought. Then it hit me.
32304005 That you are, in fact, me. And I...am the Dung Eater.
32304006 It is my flesh that must receive the blessing.
32304100 Give me your blessing.
32304101 Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.
32304102 Again and again. Until it is done.
32304103 Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself.
32304104 Countless, I have killed. And countless, I have defiled.
32304105 And soon the fruits will be borne.
32304106 Hundreds will be reborn cursed, and they'll bear thousands of cursed children, who'll bear tens of thousands more.
32304107 A few of those will be born just like me, and they'll kill, and defile, and bless in my stead!
32304108 The rotten fools. My fate was the grandest, most brilliant of them all!
32304200 My corporeal flesh lies in the sewer gaol beneath the Capital.
32304201 Give it your blessing. Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.
32304202 Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself.
32305000 Uur...urgh...
32305001 A curse... A curse upon them all.
32305002 They'll be born cursed, all of them.
32305003 Along with their children, and their children's children, heh, for all time to come�
32305100 Uur...urgh...
32305101 Curse you, Golden Order.
32305102 One day, you'll get what's coming.
32305500 Ah...argh...
32305501 No... I am... the Dung Eater...
32305502 I am...
32305503 ...
32305600 ...
32380000 <blank>
32380010 <blank>
32380020 <blank>
32400100 Oh, this is a rare occasion.
32400101 I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable.
32400102 Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome.
32400103 It is safe here. You may let down your guard.
32400200 Allow me a word of advice, as your senior.
32400201 You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more.
32400202 A house guest, yet to earn their keep.
32400203 Remember your place, newcomer.
32400300 There's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure.
32401000 What do you need? I have little time to spare.
32401100 Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?
32401101 Then you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you.
32401102 Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.
32401103 If those words held any meaning to you...
32401104 Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune.
32401105 Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open.
32401106 And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.
32401200 Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.
32401201 As a true member of the Roundtable.
32401202 I have high hopes for you.
32401203 I'm sick and tired of them.
32401204 These namby-pamby Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain...
32401300 We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to.
32401500 If you haven't anything to say, I would prefer you didn't pester me for attention.
32401501 Try not to make a spectacle of yourself either. Or are you as irredeemably foolish as you appear?
32402000 You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not?
32402001 Then just as promised, I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable.
32402002 I am known as Gideon Ofnir.
32402003 As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,
32402004 I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.
32402005 You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.
32402100 You'll be after more Great Runes, now eh?
32402101 Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge.
32402102 The inheritors of the Great Runes, the shardbearers.
32402103 We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated.
32402104 Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.
32402105 General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds.
32402106 Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir.
32402107 Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell.
32402108 And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy.
32402109 ...You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you?
32402200 So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.
32402201 Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power.
32402202 His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest.
32402203 ...but I suspect you know that well enough already.
32402300 General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.
32402301 He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.
32402302 And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat.
32402303 I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire.
32402304 And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid.
32402305 Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...
32402400 Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir.
32402401 He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour.
32402402 The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree.
32402403 It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering.
32402404 Rykard has committed the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven.
32402500 Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city.
32402501 It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau.
32402502 But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.
32402503 Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.
32402504 Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait.
32402600 The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia.
32402601 Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy.
32402602 But Rennala herself is no demigod.
32402603 Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort.
32402604 The Great Rune dwells within the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her.
32402700 There are four more demigods yet to be located.
32402701 Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed.
32402702 His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman.
32402703 Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala.
32402704 And the one only known as the Lord of Blood.
32402705 Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune,
32402706 so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers.
32402707 If you should learn anything of these matters,
32402708 I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me.
32402709 We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.
32402710 As such, I hope we are compelled to work together.
32403000 Ah, you. What is it?
32403100 Well...what is it now?
32403200 Well. I see you've found another Great Rune.
32403201 Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed.
32403202 Make the journey.
32403203 To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.
32403204 The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.
32403205 You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.
32403206 For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace.
32403300 Journey to the capital Leyndell, to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.
32403301 The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.
32403302 You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.
32403500 General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.
32403501 He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.
32403502 And by my reckoning Radahn remains there, even now.
32403503 Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...
32403600 Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city.
32403601 It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau.
32403602 But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.
32403603 Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.
32403700 The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia.
32403701 Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy.
32403702 And her Great Rune dwells within the egg she so dearly clutches.
32403800 You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not?
32403801 Then I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable.
32403802 I am known as Gideon Ofnir.
32403803 As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,
32403804 I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.
32403805 You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.
32404000 I understand you've been speaking to Nepheli.
32404001 She is my daughter.
32404002 I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace.
32404003 Though a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes.
32404004 So I put her to work.
32404005 Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you.
32404006 Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle.
32404100 Ahh, you've already heard?
32404101 Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions.
32404102 So I had no further use for her.
32404103 Honestly, what's a man to do.
32404104 A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly.
32404105 I suspect...that's just what the Queen wants.
32404106 A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished.
32404200 Is that potion what I think it is?
32404201 Bloody Seluvis. I suppose he's up to something again.
32404202 Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must.
32404203 The Roundtable has no code to speak of.
32404204 But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?
32404205 Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard?
32404300 Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself.
32404301 You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away.
32404302 Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned.
32404303 Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing.
32404304 His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold.
32404400 Well, I won't force you.
32404401 But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste.
32404402 She's not herself right now, and though I have no need of her, she still has potential.
32404403 Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet.
32404500 I hear you helped get the girl back on her feet.
32404501 Though I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you.
32404502 Sorry. For the time you had to waste.
32404600 Well, I won't force you.
32404601 If you want to do that dolly botherer's bidding, that's up to you.
32404602 Not that I could fathom why you'd want to...
32405000 Oh, my apologies for that nasty business.
32405001 Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems.
32405002 As his master, I'd like to express my regret.
32405003 But now, Ensha is slain and gone.
32405004 Finished, forever more.
32405100 Ah, yes, by way of apology,
32405101 allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess.
32405102 Find the Albinauric woman.
32405103 She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia,
32405104 She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.
32405200 Find the Albinauric woman.
32405201 She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia,
32405202 She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.
32405300 Ah, yes, by way of apology,
32405301 allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess.
32405302 Find the village of the Albinaurics.
32405303 It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands.
32405304 And some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere.
32405400 Find the village of the Albinaurics.
32405401 It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands.
32405402 Some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere.
32406000 Ahh, I know already. You're after it too, aren't you.
32406001 To pass the impenetrable thorns, you seek the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.
32406002 Then you need to reach the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.
32406010 Hah, no need to pay me for that gift.
32406011 All my knowledge is for the sake of guidance.
32406012 That a Tarnished might stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.
32406013 It doesn't have to be me, my fellow.
32406100 If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.
32406101 You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.
32406102 I marked your map with its location.
32406103 Go, if you would. Take no heed of "cardinal sin".
32406104 The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago.
32406200 If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.
32406201 You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.
32406202 Go, if you would. Take no heed of "cardinal sin".
32406203 The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago.
32407000 Ahh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion.
32407001 I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone.
32407002 You've made more of yourself than Ensha has...
32407003 Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands.
32407004 I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead?
32407005 Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath.
32407100 Ahh, so the secret medallions led you to the land of the Haligtree?
32407101 I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill.
32407102 Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely.
32407103 But...with the Haligtree as it is...
32407104 I suppose Miquella must already be...
32407200 Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.
32407201 The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:
32407202 A hidden treasure, known only to me.
32407203 You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.
32407210 Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.
32407211 The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:
32407212 A secret rite known only to me.
32407213 You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.
32407220 Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.
32407221 The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:
32407222 And it is a wondrous thing indeed.
32407223 You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.
32407300 So. The Haligtree, now but a husk...
32407301 I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree,
32407302 but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form.
32407303 Indeed, it seems those words held weight.
32407304 How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story...
32407305 Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified...
32407400 Oh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh.
32407401 A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers.
32407402 Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as they are - distant and unattainable.
32407403 But perhaps it's worth looking into...
32407404 If what I've heard is right, then maybe...
32407500 Ahh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all!
32407501 That is some fine intelligence indeed!
32407502 With it, the final clue has been brought into the light.
32407503 One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together.
32407504 As promised, allow me to impart to you
32407505 the last of the secret rites known only to me.
32407600 Well, I wonder what comes next...
32407601 If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all would be well.
32407602 But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it.
32407603 Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me...
32407700 You...burned the Erdtree, didn't you?
32407701 Then the Roundtable is soon to follow.
32407702 Ah, no need to fret about that.
32407703 The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord.
32407704 And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen,
32407705 then the Roundtable must go, as well.
32407800 I'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time.
32407801 I must learn all that can be taken from this place,
32407802 and sear it into my memory.
32407803 How could I call myself the All-Knowing, if I did any less?
32407900 The pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete.
32407901 Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing.
32407902 Perhaps the same could be said of guidance.
32407903 Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished?
32407904 What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord?
32408000 Ahh, I knew you'd come.
32408001 To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord.
32408002 What a sad state of affairs.
32408003 I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne.
32408004 Queen Marika has high hopes for us.
32408005 That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity.
32410000 You think I don't know what that is?
32410001 I have no secrets for you to salaciously gawp at.
32410002 You think too little of Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.
32480000 My fellow, you've fought well, until now.
32480100 I know...in my bones...
32480101 A Tarnished cannot become a Lord. Not even you.
32480102 A man cannot kill a god...
32500100 Ah, nice to meet you.
32500101 The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed.
32500102 I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle.
32500103 When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is.
32500104 But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle?
32500105 This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting.
32500106 Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind...
32500200 I see. Here to challenge Godrick, and lay your hands upon a Great Rune, are you?
32500201 You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace.
32500202 Well, enjoy it while you can.
32500203 I'm Tarnished, like you.
32500204 But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time.
32500205 Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.
32500206 I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.
32500207 Would you care to learn one?
32500208 As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace. I'd love to help you out, if it please.
32500300 Oh? Keen to learn another battle art, are we?
32500400 Oh hello there, good to see you safe.
32500401 Stopping by to learn a battle art or two?
32500500 The battle art you've learned is of the glintstone family.
32500501 They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle.
32500502 In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told.
32500503 Fascinating, isn't it?
32500504 That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past.
32500505 With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair,
32500506 such adaptability is more important now than ever.
32500600 Of course. I understand.
32500601 Why place trust in a perfect stranger?
32500602 Be safe, then, stranger.
32500603 Watch you don't get sacrificed, eh. I'll do the same.
32500700 Oh? Something bothering you?
32500701 Or are you just trying to pass the time?
32500702 I'm curious how you ended up inside this castle.
32502000 Ah, we meet again after all.
32502001 I apologise for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see.
32502002 So. What do you need?
32502100 Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune.
32502101 Mm, looks like we both got we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we.
32502102 Well done, friend.
32502103 Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it.
32502120 Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune.
32502121 Well done, friend.
32502122 Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it.
32502150 As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me.
32502151 No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore.
32502200 The misshapen corpse under Stormveil?
32502201 That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known.
32502202 It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring.
32502203 Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade.
32502204 And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden.
32502205 That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history.
32502206 And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.
32502207 I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot.
32502208 The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights,
32502209 You'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm?
32502210 And...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now...
32502211 I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary...
32502300 This...is a black knifeprint!
32502301 I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this!
32502302 You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes?
32502303 They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City.
32502304 A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye.
32502305 The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite.
32502306 Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time.
32502307 I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets.
32502308 Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death.
32502309 Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint...
32502310 Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see.
32502400 Oh, still need something?
32502600 Always good to see you safe.
32502601 So. What do you need?
32502700 Ah, so you've met D.
32502701 D is an old friend.
32502702 We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death.
32502703 But our paths have since diverged. Never again to cross.
32502704 Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends.
32502800 Pleased to meet you.
32502801 The name's Rogier. A sorcerer, by trade.
32502802 But now I'm in this sorry state.
32502803 I had a little mishap, and now I can't move.
32502804 As you might guess, it's far from ideal...
32502900 Ah, I know.
32502901 I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.
32502902 Would you care to learn one?
32502903 Time can move rather slowly, stuck here, you know.
32502904 A little conversation goes a long way.
32503000 Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you.
32503001 My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks.
32503050 Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives.
32503051 Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Renalla.
32503052 Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard.
32503053 Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint.
32503054 Truly, you have my thanks.
32503055 But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you.
32503056 If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,
32503057 then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.
32503058 I would like you to procure it for me.
32503059 And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.
32503100 I have some idea of Ranni's potential whereabouts.
32503101 There's a manor to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
32503102 It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends.
32503103 There's been talk of the old royals' vassals gathering there in recent years
32503104 Ranni's whereabouts since the Shattering are a well-kept secret. She hasn't been seen even once.
32503105 But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born...
32503200 If Lunar Princess Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,
32503201 then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.
32503202 Would you be willing to procure it for me?
32503203 She may have returned to the manor that is her home.
32503204 The Royal Carian residence to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
32503300 I'm afraid there's something I must tell you.
32503301 Do you know of Those Who Live in Death?
32503302 The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order.
32503303 By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged.
32503304 But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them.
32503305 You may find this peculiar,
32503306 but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives.
32503307 These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.
32503400 Yes, indeed.
32503401 If D knew what drives me now,
32503402 he would surely boil over with rage.
32503403 Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity.
32503404 But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass.
32503405 I can tell a good lie when I need to.
32504000 I see...
32504001 When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too.
32504002 You know, not everyone would trust such a tale...
32504003 But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess...
32504004 Then perhaps it's true after all.
32504005 Hmm.
32504006 Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but...
32504007 How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals?
32504008 Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course.
32504009 The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest.
32504010 And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly.
32504011 I know you've got what it takes.
32504012 Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it.
32504100 Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda?
32504101 While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly.
32504102 And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark.
32504103 I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger.
32504104 But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact.
32504500 D was telling me.
32504501 That he discovered the mark of the centipede.
32504502 The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark.
32504503 As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature,
32504504 then we may be able to form an alliance.
32504505 If only I could speak to them in person.
32504506 And if they were like you, all the better.
32504600 Hmm. Maybe I should tell you.
32504601 Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice...
32504602 Of falling into a deep...fathomless slumber.
32504603 And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow.
32504604 So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand.
32504605 Since you're so scary and all.
32504700 <sleeping>
32580000 Oof!
32580010 I fear you are mistaken.
32580011 I am no foe of yours, far from it.
32580100 This is rather unfortunate.
32580101 I don't normally find myself cornered like a rat.
32580102 But I have my ways...
32580200 No need to grandstand, you're not even on stage.
32580300 Well, this is unfortunate.
32580301 Couldn't change a thing...
32581000 Agh!
32581010 I fear you are mistaken.
32581011 I am no foe of yours, far from it.
32581100 If you think I am helpless,
32581101 you are quite mistaken, I'm afraid.
32581200 If this doesn't cause you shame, nothing will.
32581300 Well, this is unfortunate.
32581301 Couldn't change a thing...

32600100 Not seen you before.
32600101 Name's Bernahl. Tarnished, just like you.
32600102 Let me ask you something.
32600103 Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight?
32600104 Does your faith in the guidance of grace hold firm,
32600105 despite the collapse of the Golden Order?
32600200 Yes, you're a Tarnished through and through.
32600201 Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever.
32600202 Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts?
32600203 All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too.
32600204 Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.
32600300 Oh, not had your fill, eh? Worry not, I've enough to keep you busy.
32600400 Ah, hello. Glad to see you safe.
32600401 Here to learn a battle art or two?
32600500 There's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover.
32600501 Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died.
32600502 A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance.
32600503 That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat.
32600504 It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself.
32600600 Honest to a fault, I see.
32600601 Such thoughts won't behove you, as a Tarnished.
32600602 But there's nothing wrong with that.
32600603 Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts?
32600604 All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too.
32600605 Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good Tarnished, like you.
32600700 Not floating your boat, eh?
32600701 Well, there's no rush. Knowledge of the arts can wait another day.
32600800 There you are. Decided to bear the torch of my battle arts?
32600900 Well, until we meet again.
32601000 You...
32601001 What in heaven's name are you doing here?
32601002 The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind.
32601003 I hope you understand the weight of my words.
32601100 Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.
32601101 I thought you a Tarnished bred by virtue.
32601102 Perhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder.
32601103 But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.
32601104 Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.
32601200 This blasphemous path leads only to a pitiful death.
32601201 Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.
32601300 So. You've bloodied your sword in the hunt.
32601301 Then I shall introduce myself once more.
32601302 Bernahl, a recusant, just like you.
32601303 Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter.
32601304 Why not add some to your repertoire?
32601400 Oh, not had your fill, eh?
32601500 You're still alive, I see.
32601600 You've come to understand, now, eh?
32601601 To take power and make it his own,
32601602 The recusant must hunt his own kind.
32601603 To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging,
32601604 We recusants must become the most wretched of predators.
32601605 All you can do is laugh.
32601700 Look at you. A recusant through and through.
32601701 I knew you had it in you.
32601702 Take this.
32601705 A special invitation, to hunt some of the first Tarnished who sat at the Roundtable Hold.
32601706 If you should accept, I'll next see you on the field of battle.
32601800 Ah, I had hoped you'd soon return.
32601801 I have the reward from Lady Tanith.
32601802 Take it. It's yours, by right.
32601805 Let us tread the path of the recusant together.
32601806 Till we reach the miserable death that awaits us.
32602000 So. You killed Rykard?
32602001 I harbour you no ill will. The strong take. Such is our code.
32602002 Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh.
32602003 But anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more.
32602004 Though we may yet fulfil an old promise.
32602005 We hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs.
32602006 And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree.
32602100 O Greater Will, hear my voice.
32602101 I am the recusant Bernahl, inheritor of my brother's will, and you will fall to my blade.
32602102 We refuse to become your pawns. Consider this fair warning.
32603000 Who are you?
32603001 And what in heaven's name are you doing here?
32603002 The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind.
32603003 I hope you understand the weight of my words.
32604000 Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.
32604001 You have harboured doubts from the very beginning.
32604002 Perhaps this day was always lurking on the horizon.
32604003 But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.
32604004 Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.
32604100 Then you must leave immediately.
32604101 Those with weak stomachs have no place here.
32604200 I thought I told you to leave.
32604201 Or do you claim to understand?
32604202 What it means to be a recusant, renouncing grace and hunting down one's own.
32604300 Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.
32604301 But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.
32604302 Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.
32680000 Agh!
32680001 What's wrong with you?
32680002 I won't say it twice. Stop this.
32680100 I suppose I have no choice, then.
32680101 Is this what grace would have of us?
32680200 Dog eat dog, once again. A sad lot, we Tarnished.
32680300 You are an enigma, to be certain.
32680301 The Volcano Manor awaits you.
33000100 You're Tarnished, aren't you?
33000101 I welcome you, to the Church of Vows.
33000102 I am Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber.
33000103 My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs.
33000104 Do you know the origin of this place?
33000105 How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?
33000200 Well, that is a shame. But who can blame you?
33000201 The Shattering has caused us - all of us - to lose sight of something very dear.
33000202 It is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined.
33000203 By the matrimonial bond between red-haired Radagon and Rennala of the Full Moon.
33000204 And so, our church holds in view the monuments of both houses.
33000205 The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
33000300 Oh, was there something you needed?
33000301 You are free to show yourself around.
33000302 I would serve as your guide, only my legs aren't what they used to be...
33000303 If you find anything of use, you are free to take it with you.
33000304 Unless perhaps you are in search of instruction?
33000305 In which case, I will share all that I know.
33000400 Is there something else?
33001000 Greetings. Do you need anything?
33001100 Do you possess any celestial dew?
33001101 Then I would like to share my knowledge with you.
33001102 Concerning the miracle of this Church of Vows.
33001103 Radagon once cleansed himself with celestial dew,
33001104 repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala.
33001105 The Order of the Erdtree and the fate of the moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven.
33001106 This miracle blesses the church to this day.
33001107 And so, you need only follow Radagon's example,
33001108 to restore any bond, however strained or severed, to its rightful state of harmony.
33001200 My faith does not waver.
33001201 The miracle rooted in these grounds will, once again, mend the world.
33001202 And this time, its bounty will not be squandered.
33001203 If you would be Elden Lord, Tarnished,
33001204 I hope that you, too, will share my faith.
33001400 Are you taking the sword with you?
33001401 Oh, fear not, I don't wish to chide you.
33001402 Clearly, you are no conniving thief.
33001403 The sword is telling us something, no doubt.
33001404 Rather than collect dust in the shadows underground,
33001405 it yearns to be wielded by your rightful hand.
33001406 Ah, now I recall.
33001407 As the priest of the Church of Vows, I undo the sword's seal, and bequeath it unto you.
33001408 May you hold it high and proud.
33002000 Are you quite finished?
33002001 Take this opportunity to learn to master your emotions.
33002002 Worry not, I take no offence. But others are not always so forgiving.
33002003 Some take to anger, others sorrow... Bonds are fragile things, wont to break under strain.
33002004 And once they're broken, everything is lost, with naught to gain.
33002100 Are you quite finished?
33002101 I suppose my ample frame must have given you quite the fright.
33002102 Allow me to introduce myself. Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber.
33002103 My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs.
33002104 Do you know the origin of this place?
33002105 How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?
33002200 Are you quite finished, now?
33003100 To experience the miracle, kneel in the basin at the back, and cleanse yourself with celestial dew.
33003101 Absolution will be yours. Any bond, no matter how strained, or even severed, will be put to rights.
33003300 Ah, I see you have undergone absolution, the miracle that blossoms from these grounds.
33003301 Good. As such, the bond you may have strained or severed...
33003302 Has been restored, to its rightful state of harmony.
33003303 Be mindful, not to take for granted...
33003304 the serenity restored by this miracle.
33003305 And take care. Never to break a bond again.
33005000 You wish to know more of Lord Radagon?
33005001 Lord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks.
33005002 He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle.
33005003 He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen.
33005004 However. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between,
33005005 Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort.
33005006 Taking the title...of second Elden Lord.
33005007 The mystery endures, to this day...
33005008 As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside...
33005009 And moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord...
33005100 You know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret...
33005101 A famed sculptor of the Erdtree Capital was once summoned to render Lord Radagon's likeness in giant stature.
33005102 When he glimpsed the skeleton in Radagon's closet.
33005103 And as such, it's said the great statue harbours his secret too.
33005200 You wish to know more of Lady Rennala?
33005201 She is Queen, head of the Carian royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
33005202 The great and beautiful Full Moon Witch.
33005203 Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her.
33005204 And then, when the academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away in the grand library.
33005300 In the end, Lady Rennala was left alone, cradling the amber egg Lord Radagon bequeathed her.
33005301 Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite,
33005302 the grim art of reincarnation.
33005303 You would do well to remember...
33005304 Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire.
33010000 Oh, what have we here?
33010001 Very well, let us both learn together.
33010002 Heresy is not native to the world, it is but a contrivance.
33010003 All things can be conjoined.
33080000 Mngh!
33080100 Stop it, please.
33080101 My flesh is akin to stone.
33080200 I cannot be wounded. I cannot die.
33080201 But nor will I cause any harm unto you.
33080202 Cease your futile efforts.
33080300 Well, aren't we determined.
33080301 ...
33080400 ...
33080500 Aaa...aaargh!
33100100 What are you lookin' at?
33100101 You trying to start something, mate?
33100200 Oh, that necklace what you're after, is it?
33100201 Hmm, well�
33100202 Show me what it's worth to you,
33100203 and I'll consider parting ways with it.
33100204 I'm not in love with it or nothing.
33100300 You're a shrewd one, chief.
33100301 First, you hand me the runes. And don't try nothin', neither.
33100305 Hmm...
33100306 Alright. Take it.
33100307 Thing's no damn use to anyone, anyway.
33100308 Your bloody idea, mate. Don't come crying to me later.
33100400 Oh piss off, what is it now?
33100401 Oh, I see. You want some of me prawn?
33100402 Freshly cooked, it is.
33100403 Alright then. It's yours, if you can meet me price.
33100404 I could be persuaded to sell you some other bits too, if you've got the runes.
33100500 What the hell is wrong with you.
33100501 You trying to start something?
33100502 Piss off. Before I crack you in 'alf.
33100600 This bloody swine...
33100601 Decided to play ball now, 'ave you?
33100602 You'll be wantin' the necklace, then?
33100700 Think you're bloody clever, do ya?
33100701 Then how about you piss off?
33100702 fore I crack you in 'alf.
33101000 Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.
33101100 Alright mate. Want some more prawn, do ya?
33101200 Never met someone with a taste for prawn I couldn't trust.
33101201 We'd make good mates, I reckon.
33101202 I'll be seeing ya.
33101500 Oh, so you met the girl, did ya?
33101501 Alright, well, sod the particulars of the matter,
33101502 But it ain't my fault she's stupid enough to get duped, is it.
33101503 Anyway, she ain't all right, that one.
33101504 Lucky she ain't died on the bloody roadside, I reckon.
33101600 You're Tarnished too, ain'tcha?
33101601 Can you see it then? The guidance of grace, I mean.
33101602 I can't see it at all no more.
33101603 Makes no bloody sense anyway, why some no-name shithead like me should get called to the Lands Between.
33101604 Cruel bloody joke, you ask me.
33101605 Maybe something went tits up with it. Maybe... it's been broke for a good long time.
33101606 The Erdtree, I'm sayin'.
33101700 You what? Sod the particulars, mate.
33101701 Ain't my fault people are so bloody stupid, is it?
33101702 Don't like that it's stolen? Don't sodding buy it..
33102000 What are you lookin' at?
33102001 Oh...you again, is it.
33102002 Perfect bloody timing, actually.
33102003 I got crab, cooked up fresh.
33102100 Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.
33102200 Alright mate. Want some more crab, do ya?
33102300 Never met someone with a taste for crab I couldn't trust.
33102301 We've got a real thing here, eh, and it's only gettin' better.
33102500 Mate, there's somethin' I should probably tell ya.
33102501 You 'eard of the Dung Eater?
33102502 E's a madman, 'as it out for everyone. Curses 'em. Goes 'round in this rank armour, an' all.
33102503 You see 'im though, stay well away.
33102504 I was in the same gaol as him, once, so I know first 'and.
33102505 E's a god-forsaken monster. Not just some petty thug like me.
33102600 E's a killer. Kills people and curses their souls...
33102601 Does all sorts of shit to their corpses, to keep 'em cursed, forever.
33102602 I ain't seen nothin' more disgustin' in all my years.
33102603 I ain't ever been more scared, neither. Rooted to the bloody spot...
33102604 While 'e did all that, to my friend...
33102700 Yeah...and now I seen it 'ere, again.
33102701 Never thought I would. What 'e does to those bodies.
33102702 It was... It was 'im, no question.
33102703 That monster. He's lurkin' round 'ere.
33103000 Heh...serves me right.
33103001 Fitting bloody end, for a jumped up little shit with big ideas...
33103100 Help me out, would ya, mate...
33103101 I don't wanna get cursed. Just let me die...
33103102 I don't wanna live like this...not anymore...
33103103 So, please...
33103104 ...

33180000 Oof!
33180100 What's your blinkin' problem!
33180101 You don't mess with Big Boggart, mate.
33180200 That bitch put you up to this, eh.
33180201 Damn it! I'll rip you to shreds!
33180300 Not scared, are ya.
33180301 Damn it! I'll rip you to shreds!
33180400 You feel that, eh?
33180401 That's the fists of Big Boggart.
33180500 Goddamn it.
33180501 Why ain't it me, why ain't it ever...
33200100 <sigh>
33200101 Someone, please, kill him...
33200102 That horrendous serpent... Praetor Rykard...
33200200 Mm, you're Tarnished.
33200201 Here to put the demigods to the sword.
33200202 Then please. Kill the great serpent.
33200203 The one that devoured Praetor Rykard.
33200204 I left the serpent-slaying spear in the Lord's Chamber.
33200205 Worthy Tarnished, brandish the spear, and run him through.
33200206 The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity.
33200300 Praetor Rykard's ambitions, though blasphemous, marked him a worthy sovereign.
33200301 But they were reduced to gluttonous depravity, once he gave himself to the serpent.
33200302 Whatever that thing is, it is no longer Praetor Rykard.
33200303 Someone must kill him.
33200304 To spare him, and his ambitions, from further dishonour.
33200400 Worthy Tarnished. I left the serpent-slaying spear in the Lord's Chamber.
33200401 It is the only thing that can kill that horror.
33200402 Run it through. The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity...
33300100 You're Tarnished, aren't you?
33300101 Then, perhaps you could spare some runes?
33300102 Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
33300103 For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.
33300200 Well, bless you, bless you.
33300201 You are a true saint.
33300202 My name is Thops.
33300203 Presuming you're interested, I can teach you sorceries, as promised.
33300204 Only, none of them are particularly great...
33300300 Back to learn another?
33300301 Wonderful. You're most welcome, to any of my anaemic little spells.
33300400 Back to learn another?
33300401 Why, of course.
33300500 Well, I can't blame you, I suppose.
33300501 But, in the case that you do change your mind,
33300502 just speak up, loud and clear.
33300600 Oh, there you are.
33300601 Care to donate a few runes?
33300602 Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
33300603 For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.
33302000 Apologies, friend.
33302001 I'm afraid my meagre sorceries are no match for your generosity.
33302002 Oh, right.
33302003 I can tell you what I know about this place. That should help a bit.
33302004 You've seen that structure to the north, towering over the water?
33302005 That's the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Where we study glintstone sorceries.
33302006 Only, its doors have been closed for quite some time now.
33302007 After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering,
33302008 the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here.
33302009 As you might have guessed, the seals are still active,
33302010 making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key.
33302011 And so I'm stuck here. A fledgling sorcerer, with little chance of acquiring a key.
33302012 When they cast the seals, I'd just popped out, and now I'm uprooted from my place of learning.
33302100 Why not find yourself a glintstone key?
33302101 Without one, you can't pass through the academy,
33302102 and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.
33302103 And if you find an extra glintstone key, perhaps...
33302104 Once you've tied up all your loose ends - and I can be very patient -
33302105 would you consider donating it to me?
33302106 I know it. I'm a bluntstone. Nary a hint of talent for sorcery.
33302107 But still, my place is at the academy...
33302200 Oh, one more thing... Beware the Albinaurics...
33302201 ...accursed souls born of a forbidden rite of the Eternal City.
33302202 The curse withered the legs of the old, and silenced the tongues of the Frogs.
33302203 And now they hold deep grudges for anyone left untouched.
33302300 Thank you, kind soul.
33302301 For learning my paltry sorceries.
33302302 I never imagined that a bluntstone like myself would have the chance to play teacher.
33302400 Are you certain?
33302401 You're willing to give your glintstone key to me?
33302402 �My oh my!
33302403 Thank you, thank you dearly.
33302404 Now I can go back to the academy.
33302405 To resume my study...of glintstone sorceries, and the very stars.
33302406 ...
33302500 You've taken an apprenticeship with Sellen?
33302501 Well, that is something.
33302502 Sellen was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy.
33302503 I followed her at school, but there may as well have been an ocean between us.
33302504 But Sellen was expelled from the academy.
33302505 Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch.
33302506 I still don't believe the accusations.
33302507 The illustrious Sellen would never do such things...
33302600 Find yourself a glintstone key.
33302601 Without one, you can't pass through the academy,
33302602 and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.
33303000 Well, what's this?
33303001 For me, is it? But surely, that's a passing fine brew?
33303002 My meagre sorceries hardly warrant such a reward.
33303003 Oh, bless you.
33303004 I'll save it for a special occasion.
33303005 I may never have another drink like it for as long as I live.
33303100 ...
33304000 So, you've found yourself a glintstone key.
33304001 But I certainly can't take it from you.
33304002 That key belongs to you.
33304003 By rights, you should use it for yourself.
33304004 It's true, I wish to return to my place of study.
33304005 But that's no excuse to impose upon others.
33304006 Ah...is this why bluntstones always finish last?
33304100 Head to the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
33304101 Carry on with your journey. Press forward with your fight.
33304102 Don't bother holding yourself up for my sake.
33305100 Thank you dearly.
33305101 With your blessing, I will depart for the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
33305102 Perhaps, one day, you'll pay me a visit?
33305103 Who knows, I may be a decorated sorcerer by then!
33305104 Ha ha!
33310000 Oh, did I not mention?
33310001 I'm a bluntstone. I don't even have a pebble's worth of power.
33310002 So I'm afraid I can't help you decipher the scroll.
33310003 I'm sorry I'm so useless. I truly am.
33380000 Ow!
33380100 What's wrong with you?
33380101 Stop that, now. Please.
33380200 There's no getting through to you, is there.
33380300 ...
33380301 Why on earth...
33380400 Oh, Raya... Lucaria...
33380401 The home of my studies...
33400100 Be proud. You were a fine warrior.
33400101 Your only mistake was your choice of master.
33400102 Let the winds lift you, to a higher place.
33400200 Well, who do we have here?
33400201 Tarnished, are you? Clearly not one of Godrick's lot.
33400202 I am Nepheli Loux. Tarnished and warrior, like you.
33400203 I'm here by decree of my father.
33400204 How utterly repellant this is.
33400205 This "grafting" of Godrick's ill befits a Lord.
33400206 He's tainted the very winds.
33400300 If you intend to challenge Godrick,
33400301 I ask you call upon me.
33400302 The winds run foul with his deeds.
33400303 I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight.
33400400 Apologies, but I've idled long enough.
33400401 As fellow Tarnished we must each follow our own guidance.
33400402 Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.
33401000 You again...
33401001 I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.
33401002 Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.
33401003 I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.
33401004 I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.
33401005 You defeated him. You should have it.
33401006 Make good use of it.
33401007 I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.
33401010 You again...
33401011 I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.
33401012 Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.
33401013 I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.
33401014 I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.
33401015 You defeated him. You should have it.
33401016 Make good use of it.
33401017 I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.
33401100 Ah, yes.
33401101 I wonder if you've met my foster father?
33401102 He's in his study. The room Ensha's guarding just over there.
33401103 If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself.
33401104 Father is leader of the Roundtable.
33401105 I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while.
33401200 It's about time I headed off.
33401201 I'll see you again, warrior, should the fates deign it.
33401800 You again...
33401801 You received a summons to the Roundtable?
33401802 Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.
33401803 The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold.
33401900 Oh, hello.
33401901 I've not seen you here before.
33401902 I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.
33401903 Here by decree of my father.
33401904 The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold.
33402000 Is that some kind of medicine?
33402001 One that affects the heart, I'd wager.
33402002 If it's what I think, I have no need of it.
33402003 I am a warrior.
33402004 I need no external aid.
33402005 Not to brave the horrors of battle. Nor to bolster my resolve.
33403000 Oh, it's you...
33403001 <blank>
33403002 Well, what do you make of it? What's happened to this village?
33403003 I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy.
33403004 The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked.
33403100 But this time, I'm a woman grown.
33403101 And though the suffering cannot be undone, I can still mete out justice.
33403102 Justice to the oppressors.
33403103 Let the scars I carve remind them. I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.
33404000 Ah, you...
33404001 Please, leave me be.
33404002 It's pathetic, I know, but I...need to think.
33404100 ...So you know already, do you?
33404101 Right. It's true. My father cast me out.
33404102 For indulging my emotions. Forgetting the mission. Punishment for offing his pawns.
33404103 Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life.
33404104 I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord.
33404105 And yet I... Though it was not my intent...
33404106 I betrayed him...
33404200 I...can no longer trust in father...
33404201 To think he'd order his men to enact such tragedy...
33404202 Where is the justice he purports, in that?
33404203 He once told me that if he became Elden Lord,
33404204 he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again.
33404205 Was he simply lying to me?
33404300 No, no, no...
33404301 How could I say that?
33404302 Father has always given me his guidance...
33404303 And now...I've lost it...
33404304 ...
33405000 Medicine, is it?
33405001 Fine. I'll take a dose. Perhaps it'll do me some good.
33405002 ...
33405010 It's very sweet...isn't it...
33405011 And very...very...
33405012 ...
33406000 Is that ash?
33406001 I can smell the ancient storm in it...
33406002 My thanks. I'll gladly take it.
33406100 I'm...not like Roderika.
33406101 I don't feel the presence of spirits, let alone see them.
33406102 Still, this ash..
33406103 It reminds me of my first hawk.
33406104 Thank you.
33406200 In this ash, I can smell the ancient storm.
33406201 It reminds me of my first hawk.
33407000 It's been some time.
33407001 I must thank you, for your aid.
33407002 I told father I would be with him no longer.
33407003 I remembered the vow I took when I first became a warrior, so many moons ago.
33407004 This land is much like the one from which I hail.
33407005 I will call upon the storm, to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds.
33407100 Again, I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.
33407101 Some call me by the title of Lady, but I remain the same woman underneath.
33407102 Though I have now abandoned my former guidance.
33407103 I cannot express how much you've helped me.
33407200 Farewell, fellow warrior.
33407201 I will remain, to summon the storm.
33407202 But your guidance, and your fight...
33407203 Surely lie elsewhere.
33407300 I will remain, to summon the storm.
33407301 But your guidance, and your fight...
33407302 Surely lie elsewhere.
33480000 <blank>
33480100 What do you intend?
33480101 Such conduct ill befits a warrior.
33480200 I see. You are but a simple villain.
33480201 Let the scars remind you, this lesson comes from Nepheli Loux!
33480300 You wouldn't even register as a threat to father.
33480301 Hurry up and die.
33480400 Father... I am slain.
33480401 Please...become Elden Lord...
33500100 Hm.
33500101 A new face, are you?
33500102 Well, while you're here. Have you, too, been seduced by the good lady alcohol?
33500103 Perhaps you've heard of dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals?
33500104 Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it.
33500105 And if you were to help me gather its ingredients,
33500106 I'd gladly share some with you.
33500107 The Lands Between are no kind place for we Tarnished.
33500108 And I'm getting too old to keep scavenging corpses on the battlefield...
33500200 You'll help me then?
33500201 Wonderful! Music to my ears.
33500202 Then take this with you.
33500210 That, is St. Trina's Crystal Ball.
33500211 It can be used to take slumber fog from those submerged in deepest sleep,
33500212 those merry fools sunk so low they will not awaken.
33500213 Dreambrew, I should say, is a special filtration of slumber fog.
33500250 You'll help me then?
33500251 Wonderful! Music to my ears.
33500300 Go ahead and bring me some slumber fog, my compeer.
33500301 About two should do it, by my reckoning...
33500302 And then I'll have enough dreambrew to share.
33500303 Drink is a wonderful teacher. Imbibe and you will understand, this world's delights, and its futility.
33500400 You what? You hardly know what you're missing out on.
33500401 Well, suit yourself. But I'm sure you'll be after a drink before long.
33500402 Perhaps you'll tire of this crumbling world...
33500403 Or maybe you'll wish to uncover someone's deepest, darkest secrets...
33500500 What? Taken an interest in the finer things, after all?
33500501 Like dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals?
33500502 Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it.
33500503 And if you were to help me gather its ingredients,
33500504 I'd gladly share some with you.
33500505 What do you say?
33501000 Ah, I've been eagerly awaiting your return.
33501001 How did you fare? Find any slumber fog?
33501100 Hmm, not quite enough.
33501101 As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need two doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.
33501200 I see, I see. You have what I asked.
33501201 All splendid fogs of superior quality. Sediment firmly settled, mm.
33501202 Good work, my compeer.
33501203 Here's the dreambrew I promised. All yours.
33501300 Bring me more slumber fog, my compeer.
33501301 Do so, and I'll have a bottle of dreambrew with your name on it.
33501400 Allow me a little advice, my compeer.
33501401 Dreambrew is known to drag people's secrets into the daylight.
33501402 If that's what you seek, rather than the usual fleeting pleasures,
33501403 Then treat them to some dreambrew.
33501404 Secrets are like fine wine. The longer they mature in the dark, the richer the flavour...
33501405 Know that, and all will be as you desire. Friendship, rule, intrigue...
33501500 Did you forget something?
33501600 Oh, hello there.
33501601 Have you brought me some more slumber fog?
33501700 You certainly have a taste for spirits.
33501701 I'm sure I'll be seeing a lot more of you.
33501800 ...
33501900 ...
33501901 ...
33502000 As you surely know, my compeer, I am but a humble man of the cloth.
33502001 And I must profess, the study of alcohol is but another form of worship.
33502002 Oh, St. Trina. My faith is in alcohol, and the hearts of men.
33503000 Ah, good to see you.
33503001 I heard the path to the Haligtree had been reopened.
33503002 So I forced these old bones to weather the journey.
33503003 Don't tell me it was you who opened the passage?
33503004 Nevertheless, it's rather nippy in these lands, eh.
33503005 But there's nothing like a good drink to warm the cockles...
33503100 Did you need something else?
33503200 Oh it's, good, good to see you.
33503201 I think I was about to freeze solid.
33503300 ...
33503400 ...
33503401 ...
33504000 You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands.
33504001 Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery.
33504002 The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers.
33504003 Hm? That's quite a face you're pulling...
33504004 Need I remind you? Though I am but a humble man of the cloth,
33504005 each of us has our secrets, my compeer.
33504100 You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands.
33504101 Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery.
33504102 The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers.
33505000 Finally, I have found it!
33505001 St. Trina's, no, Lord Miquella's cadaver.
33505002 I have partaken of untold secrets.
33505003 Such that I might aid you, O Lord.
33505004 So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico,
33505005 Into your dream, the world of your heart.
33505006 Indeed, I beg you grant my wish,
33505007 That when you transcend from empyrean to god, allow me a place by your side.
33505100 I have partaken of untold secrets.
33505101 Such that I might aid you, O Lord.
33505102 So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico,
33505103 Into your dream, the world of your heart.
33506000 ...
33510000 Oh ho, are you asking me to partake?
33510001 Well, I haven't got a clue what to think.
33510002 Is this outright impudence? Simple callousness? Or genuine kindness, I wonder?
33510003 ...
33510004 Well, what matters it? I'll take some, regardless.
33510005 You couldn't possibly fathom the secrets I possess, my compeer.
33510100 ...
33580000 ...
33580010 Have you lost your marbles?
33580011 You do know I'm merely a beggar.
33580012 I've nothing left to give.
33580100 Haven't you Tarnished any respect?
33580101 For those who came before you.
33580200 Well, that knocked the wind out of me.
33580201 The perfect time to try that special reserve�
33580300 You base, facile, uncharitable bastard�
33580301 You're beyond help, my compeer�
33700100 Welcome, dear guest.
33700101 After being out there, it must be quite surprising,
33700102 to see our capital, cradled by the Erdtree, showered by an eternal wellspring of grace.
33700103 The sights, the sounds, the luscious scents. Each precisely as they should be. Each eternal.
33700200 Oh?
33700201 I didn't notice that you were Tarnished.
33700202 ...
33700203 Now, you mustn't take this the wrong way.
33700204 But you must leave the capital at once.
33700300 It is for your own good, I assure you.
33700301 All things have their proper place.
33700302 We, having been chosen by grace, were given this Golden Capital.
33700303 You, on the other hand, have your own home, which is a far cry from here.
33700304 So far, in fact, that it cannot be further marred by your touch.
33700305 The Shattering caused a great many fools to overstep their bounds.
33700306 Their impudence led to insurgency against Morgott, Lord of Grace. They raised an army, and sought to lay siege to this sacred ground.
33700307 But do you see where it got them? King Morgott's rule would not be shaken!
33700308 Their attempt to defile the capital failed, and while we revelled in eternal grace,
33700309 the traitors were eyed by the grotesque Fell Omen, and their corpses piled high outside the wall!
33700310 The lesson here is self-evident.
33700311 The capital is simply not where you belong.
33700400 You mustn't take it the wrong way.
33700401 But you must leave the capital at once.
33701000 Well, what have we here...
33701001 You hunt Omen, do you?
33701002 Mm-hmm, yes it appears so...
33701003 Well, then perhaps we can talk.
33701004 For a barbarous Tarnished, you see the difference between right and wrong rather clearly.
33701005 Very well. I permit your stay in the capital for the time being.
33701006 And in the name of the house of Shanehaight, I beseech you hunt down the foul Omen.
33701007 The Undercapital is a repository of waste.
33701008 For ages it's teemed with repulsive Omen. Fiendlings, even, who've never lost a horn.
33701009 And what's worse, they've taken to bellowing in a most blood-curdling manner. You can hear it all the way up here.
33701010 A vile, ceaseless affront to the Erdtree's sanctity.
33701100 Get on with it, then.
33701101 Hunt down the vile Omen scurrying about in the Undercapital, and give us peace from those wretched howls.
33701102 I know you can do it. Do not dishonour House Shanehaight.
33702000 Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?
33702001 Well, you're certainly dragging your heels more than I foresaw.
33702002 I forgive you.
33702003 We Shanehaights are known for patience, a virtue amongst the noble.
33702100 Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?
33702101 That wretched screeching... I feel as if I could go mad.
33703000 Ohh, there you are, pleased to see you.
33703001 You must've expunged the Omen from the repository.
33703002 Otherwise their revolting screeches would still be affronting my ears.
33703003 Well, you've done us a fine service, I must say.
33703004 The Erdbishops will be very pleased to hear it.
33703005 No, this is above their station...
33703006 If I explained that this was all my idea,
33703007 I could be granted audience with Morgott, Lord of Grace.
33703008 What a wondrous opportunity.
33703009 That a viscount as myself might be seen by the Lord of Grace.
33703010 Such an honour will place me amongst the most venerated Shanehaights.
33703100 Oh, very sorry, I almost forgot about you completely.
33703101 This Shanehaight heirloom has been held for generations.
33703102 It is yours now, a reward for your fearless execution of my request.
33703200 I'm afraid its worth might be lost on a Tarnished, but...
33703201 For everything, there is a first. For you, and for House Shanehaight, and its newfound glory.
33703300 Now, I need to get myself ready.
33703301 If fortune favours me, and I am seen by the Lord of Grace,
33703302 I'd be put to shame if I didn't look my very best.
33704000 Kill our lord...
33704001 He is a stain upon all things golden...
33704002 Kill Morgott, kingly impostor!

34800100 Ah...ahh...
34800200 Ngh... W-who's there?
34800201 Well, it matters not. If you are wise, you will leave, immediately.
34800202 My flesh writhes with scarlet rot.
34800203 It is a curse. Not to be meddled with by man.
34800300 If you are wise, you will leave, immediately.
34800301 My flesh writhes with scarlet rot.
34801000 You ask that I stab myself with the needle...
34801001 To quell the scarlet rot?
34801002 But...how?
34801003 ...
34801004 Never mind. I've decided.
34801005 I would rather trust you,
34801006 than simply continue to spoil from within.
34801007 Would you mind...averting your eyes for a moment?
34801115 Well. That was easier than expected.
34801116 But...why do I feel so...
34801200 ...
34802000 I...hoped to see you again.
34802001 My apologies, for when last we met. I fainted before I could even thank you.
34802002 Everything is as you said. Since inserting the needle, the scarlet rot has ceased to writhe.
34802003 Even the nightmares have abated... And now, though I can scarcely believe it myself, I can move as I please.
34802004 Not that I could ever truly repay you,
34802005 but I would like you to have this, by way of thanks. A token, though it is.
34802100 I'm considering leaving. On a journey.
34802101 With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly...
34802102 My destiny...
34802103 It's all thanks to you.
34802104 My name is Millicent. I pray fate permits us meet again.
34802200 I'm considering leaving. On a journey.
34802201 With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly...
34802202 My destiny...
34802500 Oh, hello again.
34802501 Something about this place felt familiar to me.
34802502 So I decided to pay a visit, hoping to find someone here.
34802503 But I've only found emptiness.
34802504 Perhaps before my departure, I needed someone to say farewell to.
34802600 Well, never mind that.
34802601 I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank.
34802602 I must stay strong.
34803000 Ah. We meet again.
34803001 In truth, it's been smooth sailing, for me.
34803002 The scarlet rot has stilled, since last we met.
34803003 As such, I've been able to continue my journey.
34803004 Though rather vexingly,
34803005 I realise that if I still had my sword arm,
34803006 I could have aided you in battle.
34803100 Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took,
34803101 after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn, in the Caelid Wilds.
34803102 I should like to meet her, this vanished woman.
34803103 I think she's in the north.
34803104 In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.
34803200 Are you...
34803201 Giving me this arm?
34803202 I thank you.
34803203 I am in your debt, yet again.
34803204 I think, If the arm serves well enough,
34803205 It might be possible for me to wield a sword again.
34803300 If the arm serves well enough,
34803301 It might be possible for me to wield a sword again.
34803302 Perhaps, then, I can aid you in battle.
34803500 Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took.
34803501 She's passed into to the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.
34804000 Ah, we meet yet again.
34804001 The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder.
34804002 It feels just like my own, even handling a sword.
34804003 Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword.
34804004 Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle again, should you ever have the need.
34804100 Ah, we meet yet again.
34804101 The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder.
34804102 It feels just like my own, even handling a sword.
34804103 Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword.
34804104 Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need.
34804200 I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need.
34804201 It is the only way that I can express my thanks.
34805000 To think we'd meet in such a place...
34805001 What could your purpose possibly...
34805002 No, I know well enough who you are, and what I know is good enough for me.
34805003 Call upon me again in battle, should you have the need.
34805100 I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins.
34805101 I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree.
34805102 Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found.
34805103 The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands.
34805200 I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins.
34805201 I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree.
34806000 Again we meet.
34806001 I can only surmise our purposes are aligned.
34806002 In which case, allow me to explain myself.
34806003 I am of Malenia's blood.
34806004 But in what capacity I know not. I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot�
34806005 Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us.
34806100 There is something I must return to Malenia.
34806101 The will that was once her own.
34806102 The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.
34806103 The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure.
34806200 There is something I must return to Malenia.
34806201 The will that was once her own.
34806202 The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.
34807000 Oh, hello.
34807001 Thank you for lending your hand.
34807002 Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet.
34807003 I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end.
34807004 Thank you. With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing.
34807100 But this is where things end.
34807101 I pause to even tell you, but...
34807102 I took out the needle myself.
34807103 Tell whoever put you up to this.
34807104 That if I am to flower into something other than myself,
34807105 I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.
34807200 Please, let me pass alone.
34807201 The scarlet rot writhes now, worse than ever.
34807202 Soon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh.
34807203 Curse-laden. Untouchable.
34807204 I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm.
34880000 Ugh.
34880100 Is there something wrong?
34880101 Please, cease this at once.
34880200 Why are you doing this?
34880201 Now you've forced my hand.
34880300 I will not forget what you did for me.
34880301 But this day marks our farewell.
34880400 I did not imagine it ending like this.
34880401 But I will not forget what you have done.
34880500 Ahh, how could you...
34880501 Is this your true heart?
34880502 Was I... was it all...for this?
34900100 Oh, a pleasure to see you, a pleasure indeed.
34900101 I am Gowry. A great sage, in my day, anyway.
34900102 I'd hoped to ask a favour, when one of your ilk came along.
34900103 A strapping young Tarnished, able to cross the scarlet swamp of Aeonia.
34900104 Don't fret, I'll provide fine recompense.
34900105 Should you accept�
34900106 I will teach you the secret of Sellia, the town you see there.
34901000 Ah, then you're willing to lend a hand, are you?
34901001 I need your help to heal a certain young girl.
34901002 Her name is Millicent. You will find her beyond Sellia,
34901003 resting at the church atop the cliff, stricken by the rotting sickness.
34901100 The rotting sickness that afflicts Millicent has no cure.
34901101 When the Erdtree flourished, even the demigods could not stave off its effects, despite their nigh godhood.
34901102 But Millicent's suffering can be ameliorated.
34901103 For this, you are to find a certain needle.
34901104 Seek the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia, outside Sellia's bounds.
34901105 The needle, made from unalloyed gold, is lost somewhere there.
34901200 First, you must find the unalloyed gold needle.
34901201 It's hidden somewhere in the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia.
34901202 Then I will tell you, as promised.
34901203 The secret of the town of Sellia.
34901300 Ah, my apologies. I rather got ahead of myself, didn't I.
34901301 Well, no matter. I'm accustomed to waiting.
34901302 But if you should decide to hear my offer, whenever that may be,
34901303 do come and speak with me again.
34901304 I'll wait as long as it takes.
34901400 Ah, changed your mind, have you?
34901401 If you are willing to undertake my request,
34901402 I'll gladly share with you the secret of Sellia, the town yonder.
34902000 Ohh, you've found the unalloyed gold needle.
34902001 As promised, I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here.
34902002 Go on, it's yours.
34902013 Now, let me have a look at the needle.
34902014 Hmm.
34902015 Hmmmm.
34902016 Well, well, this is a marvel indeed.
34902017 The work of a true artisan�a meticulous, bold craftsman who grasps the essence of life.
34902018 Can you give me some time with this?
34902019 As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it.
34902100 I have awaited your return.
34902101 The needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness, I'm sure.
34902102 Will you give it to the girl, Millicent?
34902103 I will reward you in kind.
34902114 Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder.
34902115 Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god.
34902116 A wretched fate, indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this.
34902200 Do you find it peculiar?
34902201 That I would show such concern for the girl.
34902202 Well, I'm the one that found her.
34902203 A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia.
34902204 She is one of my dear daughters.
34902205 But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory.
34902206 I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me.
34902207 Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much.
34902208 Ha ha ha...
34902300 Can you give me some time with this?
34902301 As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it.
34902700 Now, all you need do is deliver the needle to Millicent.
34902701 She's convalescing in the church atop the cliff just beyond Sellia.
34902702 Do so, and you shall receive handsome recompense, of course.
34903000 Thank you kindly.
34903001 For giving the needle to Millicent.
34903002 Now she, too, can begin her journey.
34903003 And stare her fate straight in the eye.
34903004 You've been a saint, through and through.
34903005 As thanks, I vow to impart to you my knowledge
34903006 of the lost sorceries of the Sellians, descendants of the Eternal.
34903100 Please make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed.
34903101 Like her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior,
34903102 but commands only one arm, and is yet preciously young.
34903200 Oh, you noticed, did you?
34903201 Indeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home.
34903202 It seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, but faintly.
34903203 However, she has no need of me, any more.
34903204 No, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede.
34903205 As I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young...
34903206 Is to be forgotten.
34903500 Ah, welcome, welcome. How may I help?
34903600 Do you...need me for something else?
34904000 So, you gave Millicent a golden arm replacement�
34904001 This is a wonderful development.
34904002 Thank you for your kindness.
34904003 Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential.
34904004 Like her beautiful mother.
34904100 The girl, Millicent. She is a bud.
34904101 Green and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence.
34904102 What a wondrous day that will be.
34904103 In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality.
34904104 She might very well outshine her sisters.
34905000 Do you have an interest in rot incantations?
34905001 Then you might like to learn something of the history...
34905002 of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot.
34905100 Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them.
34905101 She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot.
34905102 An Empyrean...is no mere demigod.
34905103 In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika,
34905104 the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order.
34905105 Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her.
34905106 And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth.
34906000 Oh, Millicent. Finding herself, is she?
34906001 The words of a true innocent, the dear girl.
34906002 Well, perhaps this is just as it should be.
34906003 Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what.
34906004 This is their fate, after all.
34907000 <sobbing>
34907100 Oh, mm, I didn't notice you there.
34907101 Welcome. How may I help you?
34907102 My apologies though, you hardly needed to see me like that.
34907200 Oh, it's just�
34907201 I realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and�
34907202 My eyes began to well...
34907203 She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters.
34907204 And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.
34907210 Which is why...
34907211 If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters,
34907212 I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent.
34907213 It must be done by your hand, no other.
34907214 Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact.
34907215 Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly.
34907216 When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn.
34907217 As a scarlet valkyrie.
34907300 Thus, I have a request of the utmost import.
34907301 I beg you, kill Millicent.
34907302 Before the girl can meet her sisters.
34907303 There is no other way. It must be done by your hand alone.
34907304 You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart.
34907305 Which will flower most vividly, should she be plucked by you.
34907306 Malenia will be a goddess. And once she is, Millicent will flower anew, as a scarlet valkyrie.
34907400 You can't tell me you don't wish to see it.
34907401 The superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers?
34907402 I beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands.
34907500 Welcome, welcome. How may I help you?
34907501 Oh how I have counted the days. Millicent shall soon meet her sisters.
34907600 When the time is ripe...
34907601 Do what you must to ensure Millicent dies.
34907610 <sigh>
34907611 Millicent, my daughter.
34907612 Why would you take out the needle?
34907613 You were so close. So very close. To becoming the fairest of all flowers.
34907614 Would you disown us too? As your Mother did?
34907615 We children of the scarlet rot?
34907800 Millicent...
34907801 Malenia...
34907802 Do you detest us, so utterly?
34908000 Have you taken the lesson, now?
34908001 Killing me is but an exercise in futility.
34908002 All is well, provided you understand.
34908003 Let's just pretend it never happened, shall we?
34908010 <sobbing>
34908011 O Millicent, my daughter...
34908012 Who would prune your sapling flesh?
34908013 Such...such cruel and vulgar violence...
34908014 <sobbing>
34910100 Oh, Millicent...
34910101 My most promising little bud...
34910102 <sobbing>
34980000 Owgh!
34980100 Please, enough.
34980101 There is nothing to be gained by persevering.
34980200 So, the lesson remains unlearned.
34980201 Perhaps you've taken one knock to the head too many.
34980300 We shall meet again, you and I.
34980301 There are countless pests to choose from.
34980400 We shall meet again.
34980401 As many times as it takes. For you to understand.
35100100 Oh, I see you've just arrived.
35100101 Welcome to the Roundtable Hold. I'm Corhyn, a man of the cloth.
35100102 I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the Two Fingers,
35100103 and explore the secrets of the Golden Order.
35100104 So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them,
35100105 ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men.
35100106 By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace.
35100200 You do! Wonderful news.
35100201 Most Tarnished are blind to it these days.
35100202 You are something of a rare breed.
35100203 Well, what do you say? Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers?
35100300 Ah, well, that is unfortunate.
35100301 But no cause for despair.
35100302 It's likely a temporary condition, I'm told. For whatever reason, it happens from time to time.
35100303 Just keep your chin up, and stay the path.
35100304 I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you.
35100400 What is it?
35100401 Has the guidance of grace returned to your vision?
35100500 Ah, I see.
35100501 Just keep your chin up, and stay the path.
35100502 I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you.
35101000 Further study of incantations, is it?
35101001 I can happily spare the time, and applaud your enthusiasm.
35101100 Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good.
35101101 Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation?
35101200 May the Golden Order shine through you.
35101500 There's something I should mention to you, as well.
35101501 I'm thinking of leaving the Roundtable Hold.
35101502 Do you know of the noble Goldmask?
35101503 Though he was but a Tarnished, living outside the Lands Between,
35101504 he was a great scholar, who foresaw the coming guidance of grace.
35101505 And now, I hear he has come to the Lands Between alone, to contemplate the Golden Order...
35101506 I wish nothing more than to seek his instruction, and perhaps even help him in his research.
35102000 Ah, I had been waiting for your return.
35102001 I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold after all.
35102002 As I mentioned, I'm off in search of the noble Goldmask.
35102003 We may not meet again for some time.
35102004 If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment.
35102100 Ah, I had been waiting for your return.
35102101 I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold.
35102102 I'm off in search of a noble scholar known as the Goldmask, to beg his instruction.
35102103 We may not meet again for some time.
35102104 If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment.
35103000 Ah, look who we have here.
35103001 How delightful, to meet a familiar face, even after departing the Roundtable Hold.
35103002 I've been doing some learning of my own since then, actually.
35103003 And will happily pass it along to you.
35103500 I'm yet to find the noble Goldmask.
35103501 I suppose he'll be closer to the Erdtree.
35103502 The path ahead might be perilous, but tread it I shall.
35103503 Since departing the Roundtable Hold, I've come to understand, in my solitude,
35103504 How little it is I truly know...
35103600 Do...do you sport with me!?
35103601 From your description, it can be no other than the Goldmask himself!
35103602 Of course, of course, I knew he would be close by.
35103603 Bless the Golden Order, and its benevolent rays.
35103604 And to you too. My sincerest thanks.
35103700 I will soon leave to join the noble Goldmask.
35103701 It is entirely thanks to you. You have my sincerest gratitude.
35104000 Ah, we meet yet again.
35104001 Thanks to you, I have become acquainted with the noble Goldmask himself,
35104002 and taken my place by his side, as you can see.
35104003 Have no fear, I will still teach you incantations, as before.
35104004 Though we must do so quietly, such that we not disturb the great master's cogitation.
35104100 Further study of incantations, is it?
35104101 Indeed, I applaud your enthusiasm.
35104200 Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good.
35104201 Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation?
35104300 May the Golden Order shine through you.
35104500 The master is always deep in contemplation.
35104501 While I frantically attempt to record his wisdom, the movement of his finger.
35104502 And though I am yet to comprehend even the daintiest morsel of his wisdom...
35104503 I know that this, this is my life's calling.
35104504 The Golden Order has bestowed me, talentless as I am, the great duty of documentarian.
35104600 Master! What ever is the matter?
35104601 Please, I implore you continue! Continue your reflections, your rhythms!
35104602 I must be the one to record them!
35104603 What matters this issue of Radagon, really?
35104604 The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!
35104605 Why must these qualms come to you now?
35104606 We were on the very cusp!
35104700 Oh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed.
35104701 I'm a little shaken since the master ceased his movements.
35104800 Did you need something else?
35104900 Oh, was that you?
35104901 Yes, the master is still ceased.
35104902 And after coming all this way... Why now, of all times?
35105000 The master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree.
35105001 While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild.
35105002 Until he simply ceased.
35105003 Now the master is facing quite the puzzle.
35105004 The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However...
35105005 The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared...
35105006 Who exactly was Radagon?
35105007 The master is stumped.
35105008 His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.
35105009 Curse my mediocre mind.
35105010 The master only has me, and here I fail him...
35105100 What on earth did you do to the master?
35105101 Well, not that I'm complaining.
35105102 Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation, more than good enough for me.
35105103 I haven't the words to thank you.
35105104 So I'd like to pass this on to you instead.
35105105 A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly.
35105200 To think, that Radagon was Marika herself.
35105201 Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger.
35105202 How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder.
35105203 Sadly, I cannot comprehend it, myself.
35105204 Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter?
35105205 ...
35105206 Well, either way, I can continue my documentation.
35105207 In truth it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not,
35105208 I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose.
35105300 Who exactly was Radagon?
35105301 The master is stumped.
35105302 His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.
35105303 But oh, how important could it really be?
35105304 The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!
35105305 Why must these qualms come to you now?
35105306 We were on the very cusp!
35106000 Ah, nice to see you.
35106001 I can't believe you've come all this way.
35106100 Do you need...something else?
35106200 Ah, nice to see you.
35106201 Do you need...something else?
35106500 I've�been gripped by a terrifying thought.
35106501 The rhythms and calculus of the master's finger...
35106502 betray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order.
35106503 A conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked.
35106504 Oh, but how could this be?
35106505 I dread to even entertain the possibility...
35106506 but somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master.
35106507 Tell me, have I simply lost my head?
35106508 Only, if the master were true to the Golden Order,
35106509 why would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire?
35106600 Oh master, put my mind at ease.
35106601 Dispel these fearsome thoughts.
35106602 I want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe.
35106603 <sobbing>
35106700 What...is this?
35106701 It will make me forget, you say?
35106702 So that I can push aside these frightful thoughts...
35106703 Ha...ha ha...
35106704 Would that I could... Would that I could...
35107000 Oh, it's you.
35107001 I've finally come to understand.
35107002 The master was nothing more than a madman.
35107003 Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order,
35107004 seeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own!
35107005 Could there be a more pitiable comedy?
35107006 Look at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes!
35107007 Ha...ha ha ha...
35108000 Master...where did you go?
35108001 I'm right here. Please, show me.
35108002 Your finger. Your rhythms, and calculus.
35108003 Let me document the motions...
35108004 Master...master...
35108005 Where did you go?
35109000 This...is a volume of incantation.
35109001 It's good to see your enthusiasm.
35109002 Indeed, I will happily take it off your hands.
35109100 That...is a work of heresy.
35109101 Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.
35109102 My interests lie solely in the Golden Order.
35109103 I cannot accept this.
35109200 That...is a work of heresy.
35109201 Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.
35109202 ...
35109203 Very well...I'll take it off your hands.
35109204 I cannot afford to maintain my innocence any longer. I must dirty my hands to test my faith.
35109205 Even if it offers only the most meagre of hints, I will do whatever I can to help my master.
35109210 That...is a work of heresy.
35109211 Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.
35109212 ...
35109213 Very well...I'll take it off your hands.

35110004 <blank>
35180000 Ngh!
35180100 What are you trying to achieve?
35180101 Cease that!
35180200 You've done it now.
35180201 Faith grants me strength, that I might endure.
35180202 O Golden Order, shine through me.
35180300 I pray...
35180301 That the guidance of grace abandons you.
35180400 Please don't trouble us again.
35180500 O guidance...of grace...
35180501 Why...can't I...
35180600 O, master...
35180601 To be ever...at your side...
70000100 ...
70000101 A proper death means returning to the Erdtree.
70000102 Have patience. Until the time comes...and the roots call to you.
70001000 ...
70001001 O Marika, Queen Eternal. He is your unwanted child.
70002000 ...
70002001 O Sapling! Sweet sapling of glorious gold.
70002002 Has your crystal teardrop ripened?
70003000 ...
70003001 Unthinkable. Our hallowed resting place is violated.
70003002 To refuse the Erdtree's call to return, to live within Death... Sickening.
70004000 ...
70004001 The demi-humans wax wroth, now their mother's been taken...
70004002 Where are you, Lord Kenneth?
70004003 The knight...bedeviled by blood.
70005000 ...
70005001 Please, help me. I'm of noble blood.
70005002 If those hideous mongrels eat me, I'll be forever marred...
70005003 Anything but that, please! Think of the disgrace!
70006000 ...
70006001 All I wanted was to fight. To fight, as a warrior, to the last...
70006002 So, why? Why, O guidance of grace, will this door not open?
70007000 ...
70007001 Maiden, dear maiden, where are you?
70007002 Please, take my grapes.
70008000 ...
70008001 Ohh, there it is, the tower!
70008002 Finally, I can return. To our home, bathed in rays of gold!
70100100 ...
70100101 This village is done for.
70100102 Please, even if it's just you, old Albus, hide well and still your breath.
70101000 ...
70101001 Ahh, Lord Vyke, it seems that you were no lord, after all.
70101002 Then where is he? Our true Lord, our Lord of Frenzied Flame.
70101003 We beg of you, incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.
70101004 Ahh, may chaos take the world!
70102000 ...
70102001 Ahh, the puppets...
70102002 The puppets besiege us...
70103000 ...
70103001 Raya Lucaria, hallowed hall dedicated to the study of magic.
70103002 Why shut your doors to me? Am I barred from donning the crown of stone?
70104000 ...
70104001 Ahh, Iji, forgive me.
70104002 These royal grounds were placed in our trust,
70104003 but we stood no chance.
70105000 ...
70105001 O Celestial Globe, transmit to posterity. The wisdom of the moon and stars.
70105002 And obscure, forever, the transgressions of the princess.
70106000 ...
70106001 Lady Ranni, we have long awaited you.
70106002 I pray for your house's swift revival.
70106003 May the full moon shine upon Caria.
70107000 ...
70107001 Come out, one and all, from the darkness underground.
70107002 And let us offer unto the maiden our eyes.
70108000 ...
70108001 Ahh, the poor fellow...gone perfectly mad.
70108002 Love...revenge...the frenzied flame melts it all away...
70109000 ...
70109001 It's there, somewhere.
70109002 Another path, leading back to the foot of the Erdtree.
70109003 An ancient tunnel.
70200100 ...
70200101 Eek... I hear a festive melody...
70200102 No, no, don't skin me...
70200103 My hide is filthy, I swear...
70201000 ...
70201001 Ohh, Erdtree, great Erdtree.
70201002 The Golden Order itself, unwavering, stretched to the sky.
70201003 Confer your guidance. To our Elden Lord.
70201004 To put this weary world to rights...
70202000 ...
70202001 Lord Rykard...
70202002 If this putrid field of death is what your blasphemy would bring,
70202003 then I can no longer abide.
70202004 No one can.
70203000 ...
70203001 House Marais is ruined...
70203002 Just deserts, for falling for that severed harpy.
70203003 No surprise that guilty cretin took the castle and our storied sword...
70204000 Eek...! The wretched fools...
70204005 They'll never find me.
70204010 Heh heh... I'll survive, I swear it.
70204011 I'll soon be back at the Volcano Manor.
70300100 ...
70300101 Sublime, I tell you.
70300102 The very first flower of Aeonia bloomed on this very spot.
70300103 Malenia, may you blossom into a goddess.
70301000 ...
70301001 Convene the festival of war.
70301002 Honor General Radahn, with a warrior's glory.
70301003 It's in your hands, Sir Jerren...
70302000 ...
70302001 Let me see it, if only one last time.
70302002 Your splendid blade, dancing amongst the scarlet rot.
70303000 ...
70303001 I'm dry, dry as a bone...
70303002 Fool dragon, surrender your strength.
70303003 Let me feast on your heart.
70304000 ...
70304001 It's rotting.
70304002 Everything, rotting scarlet.
70304003 The very earth that Caelid rests upon, and Sellia, town of sorcery.
70304004 The end is nigh, for us all.
70400100 ...
70400101 Ohh great sun! Frigid sun of Sol!
70400102 Surrender yourself to the eclipse!
70400103 Grant life to the soulless bones!
70401000 ...
70401001 Lord Miquella, forgive me.
70401002 The sun has not been swallowed. Our prayers were lacking.
70401003 Your comrade remains soulless...
70401004 I will never set my eyes upon it now...
70401005 Your divine Haligtree...
70402000 ...
70402001 Show me the path, O gentle lights.
70402002 The promised path to the Haligtree!
70403000 ...
70403001 Only...a little further now...
70403002 Show me the path, O gentle lights...the path to Elphael.
70404000 ...
70404001 Mohg, you rotten Omen. Your blood is cursed.
70404002 Give him back.
70404003 Give Lord Miquella back!
70404004 How dare you lay hands on such precious flesh!
70500100 ...
70500101 Lord of Blood, your eminence.
70500102 I beg you, grant me a seat at the table of the dynasty.
70500103 Long live the Mohgwyn Dynasty.
70500104 Long live! The Mohgwyn Dynasty!
70600100 ...
70600101 Behold. The Erdtree yet stands.
70600102 Tall and unwavering, mindless of the scorch of the flame of ruin.
70600103 Hahah, Hahah...
70600104 Then, we are yet Golden Ones.
70601000 ...
70601001 He is returned! The Lord has returned at long last.
70601002 Our very first lord, to brandish the Elden Ring once more...
70602000 ...
70602001 Brave Tarnished. Take the plunge.
70602002 Of learning, and remembrance.
70602003 Recall the arts of war. And your warrior's blood.
80000100 You're a Tarnished, I can see it.
80000101 And I can also see...
80000102 That you're not after my throat.
80000103 Then why not purchase a little something?
80000104 I am Kal�. Purveyor of fine goods.
80000200 What is it? Still going to purchase something?
80000300 Wait, weren't you...?
80000301 Well, you're back. Care to buy something?
80000400 Ah, it's you again.
80000401 Always a pleasure. Care to purchase anything?
80000500 Good-bye for now.
80000600 Good-bye. Nice to do business.
80000700 I am of a nomadic people.
80000701 Selling wares as I travel.
80000702 The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring.
80000703 It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely.
80000704 Let's say you're a very welcome customer.
80000800 You know, if you can spare the runes,
80000801 you should buy yourself a crafting kit.
80000802 A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own.
80000803 Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration.
80000804 The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut.
80000805 But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all.
80000900 I'm glad you took my warning to heart.
80000901 You've made an excellent choice.
80001000 There are others of my people who yet survive in these lands.
80001001 If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you?
80001002 My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold.
80001003 Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey.
80001004 But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered.
80001005 I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts.
80001006 Your people, the Tarnished, and mine.
80001100 I suppose I shouldn't keep this from you.
80001101 I'm thinking of moving elsewhere for a time.
80001102 My people are wanderers all, which I won't deny is one reason...
80001103 But I've done all I can here, in search of the Great Caravan.
80001200 Perhaps you don't need to hear this, but...
80001201 See that no harm comes to my kin.
80001202 We have a saying, we wanderers.
80001203 Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing.
80001204 But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy.
80001205 That is our code, so to speak.
80001206 Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving.
80001300 Ah, by the way...
80001301 Have you heard of the Great Caravan?
80001400 ...I see, more's the pity.
80001401 Well, even we had a place to call home, once.
80001402 The Great Caravan, they called it� but it's been lost to us for ages.
80001403 I've been searching for it as long as I can remember.
80001404 And with a name like that,
80001405 You'd hope they kept some fine goods there, eh.
80001500 The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood...
80001501 I suppose he must still be skulking about...
80001502 Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself?
80001503 Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source.
80001504 Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear.
80001505 I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off.
80001600 Oh, by the way. There's someone you should meet.
80001601 If you happen to hear a wolf's howl, make this signal under the source.
80001700 Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you?
80001701 Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction.
80001702 He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg.
80001703 I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another.
80003000 Ah, good to see you.
80003001 I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.
80003002 Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.
80003003 A pleasure, as ever. Care to purchase anything?
80003100 We meet again, I see.
80003101 It's me, Kal�.
80003102 Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.
80003103 Right then. Care to purchase anything?
80003200 Have you seen a crow around here by any chance?
80003201 You know, a burial crow, with a letter fastened to its claw?
80003202 Well, if you do set eyes upon it, I'll buy that letter from you, no question.
80003203 I'd give you a generous sum for it, of course.
80003300 My thanks. I've been wanting to get my hands on this.
80003400 So, about the letter you brought me...
80003401 It's just as I suspected, it features a cryptogram of my people.
80003402 And I'm sure it's come from wherever the Great Caravan disappeared to.
80003403 This could be my chance to get close to it.
80003404 Thanks to you.
80003500 Once I decipher that cryptogram, I'll be packing up shop again.
80003501 Don't worry, I'll leave a sign that shows where I've gone.
80003502 With any luck, I'll see you there, eh.
80003600 I've always preferred my own company, to that of other people's...
80003601 And I don't have any burning questions I wish to ask my ancestors...
80003602 But there's something I need to know.
80003603 My roots.
80003604 I want to know who I am. Where I came from. Where I'm headed.
80005000 Ah, good to see you.
80005001 I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.
80005002 The shop is all set up.
80005003 A pleasure as ever. Care to purchase anything?
80005100 Oh yes, about the cryptogram from the letter...
80005101 I think it's pointing here, underneath the capital.
80005102 But I'm perplexed as to the path to take down there.
80005103 Well, the journey can wait, I suppose.
80005104 I'll settle here for the time being, and start looking into it.
80005200 Where...did you find this letter?
80005300 I can't imagine how it ended up there...
80005301 But the well might just lead under the capital.
80005302 To the spot indicated by the cryptogram from the letter.
80005303 Seems like an odd place for the Great Caravan...
80005304 But no amount of thinking will change anything. I'll be heading straight there, after some preparation.
80005305 Once again, I find myself in your debt.
80005306 Take this, as a token of my appreciation.
80005307 It's not from my usual stock, but something rather more special.
80005310 I hope you can join me at the Great Caravan, in fact.
80005311 Who knows what wonders there might be to trade?
80005400 Ah, you, is it...
80005401 Did you see? What they did to my ancestors?
80005402 The whole clan, buried alive. Sick. Maddened. Husks of themselves.
80005403 Have you heard their moans? They're hardly human anymore.
80005404 They think we worship the Three Fingers? That we called the maddening sickness down upon them?
80005405 Well. If that's what they expect from us, then that's what they shall get from us!
80005406 The world of grace and its people should have been content to see us sink between the cracks.
80005407 But to have intruded upon our solace... Having broken us upon their whims...
80005408 I'll never forgive any of you.
80005500 I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer.
80005501 And...I think it's time we parted ways.
80005502 Guided by grace, you seek to become Elden Lord.
80005503 I don't want anything to do with you Tarnished lot any more.
80005600 I should apologise to you.
80005601 It's my fault that we stumbled into this mess.
80005602 I'm sorry.
80005700 I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer.
80005701 I think it's time we parted ways.
80005800 Wait, what's that?
80005801 That burn...
80005802 You've inherited the flame of frenzy!
80005803 Oh, that's it... That's what I need...
80005804 To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.
80005805 The yellow flame of chaos...
80005900 Oh, that's it... That's what I need...
80005901 To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.
80005902 The yellow flame of chaos...
80007000 O Three Fingers, throw wide the door.
80007001 Please, bestow unto me the yellow flame of chaos.
80007002 A frenzied flame to melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.
80007003 May chaos take the world.
80007004 May chaos take the world.
80007100 The frenzied flame...burned me...
80007101 I was not... a suitable home.
80007102 Unknown warrior...
80007103 You, who reached the Three Fingers' abyss...
80007104 Tell the one... Who will become Lord...
80007105 Divest yourself of everything, and head to the door.
80007106 Divest yourself of everything...
80007107 And pray to the Lord...
80007108 To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.
80007109 May chaos...take the world.
80007110 ...
80007200 The frenzied flame...burned me...
80007201 I was not... a suitable home.
80007202 Dear Lord, Lord of Chaos...
80007203 Melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.
80007204 May chaos...take the world.
80007205 ...
80080000 Urgh!
80080100 What's the matter with you?
80080101 Have you gone mad?
80080200 I knew you for a highwayman all along.
80080201 Then it's time you learnt a lesson.
80080202 Our people will not stand for your barbarism!
80080300 Is that all you were, mate?
80080400 Is this...how it ends?
80080401 I'll never find...
80081000 <takes damage>
80081100 So you're just like the others?
80081101 Another would-be oppressor to my people.
80081200 I see. I see how it is! You were one of them all along!
80081201 Trying to trample us underfoot, you grace-given bastard?
80081300 I'll never forgive your kind...
80081400 Your kind...will all be razed clean.
80081401 By the frenzied flame...of chaos...
80100100 Ahh, welcome...dear customer.
80100101 Yes, right this way... Right this way...
80100200 Welcome...
80100201 Valued customer... Come trade, in our wandering emporium.
80100202 Please, buy something...
80100203 I'm hungry. I've been hungry so long. Please.
80100300 Ahh, hello.
80100301 How nice of you to stop by, again.
80100302 Please, buy something, won't you?
80105000 You're new around here.
80105001 Surprised you found me in my little nook.
80105002 No matter, no matter. Your money's as good as anyone else's.
80105003 Why don't you take a look at my wares?
80105004 Oh, but...
80105005 Don't ask me how I got my hands on them, eh.
80105100 Ah, back again are we?
80105101 Not everyone can tell how good my wares are. You've a discerning eye, you have.
80110000 Mm? Ohh...
80110001 A...custom...er?
80110100 Hello...again...
80110101 G-good...customer...
80110200 Hello...again...
80110201 You...g-good customer...
80110300 G-good...bye...
80110301 Till nex...t-time...
80115000 Buying or selling?
80115100 Not finished yet?
80115200 Trade again?
80115300 Be well.
80120000 Ooh, dear.
80120001 Oh, dear, terribly sorry.
80120002 Are you here as a customer?
80120100 Oh...
80120101 Is there anything wrong?
80120200 Ooh!
80120201 Ah, oh, terribly sorry...
80120202 I-I didn't realise you came back.
80120300 I-I must apologise.
80120301 I'm afraid I've very little to offer.
80120400 Oh, nothing that suits your tastes, then?
80120401 Heh heh...
80125000 What do you need?
80125001 I don't want any trouble.
80125100 You again?
80125101 I don't want any trouble.
80125200 All done?
80125201 Well, be on your way, then.
80130000 Well�
80130001 It's been an age since I've seen a customer.
80130002 How can I help, here at the end of the earth?
80130100 Anything else for you?
80130200 Back already?
80130201 Unusual fellow, aren't we.
80130202 Did this aged merchant have something that caught your eye?
80130300 Have a safe journey.
80135000 Is someone there?
80135001 A customer?
80135002 Well, how long has it been.
80135100 Something else?
80135200 Well, there you are again.
80135201 Divorce from one's trade does not come easily.
80180000 Agh!
80180010 Please! Stop this, good customer!
80180100 Bollocks! What the devil's wrong with you!
80180200 Dirty little thief...
80180300 You dirty little thief...
80180301 Melt away with the rest of it...
80181000 Owgh!
80181010 What are you playing at! Stop this!
80181100 That's the last straw, you bloody thief!
80181200 Stay away, Us wanderers have had enough.
80181300 How dare you trample us.
80181301 You filthy thief.
80182000 A-agh!
80182001 S...stop
80182010 P...please, s...stop
80182100 E...enough
80182101 M...melt away...
80182200 G-good...bye...
80182201 Dear...customer...
80182300 But, why...?
80182301 Kind...sir...
80182400 You've always...
80182401 been...too kind...
80183000 Ngh!
80183010 Enough.
80183100 Another thief? Fine.
80183200 What folly.
80183300 How in the...
80183301 Blast...
80184000 Eh!
80184001 Please!
80184002 Please, stop this!
80184010 It was me! It's all my fault!
80184011 Please, don't hurt me!
80184100 I said don't hurt me!
80184101 Aaargh!
80184200 I warned you. I told you to stop...
80184300 How could you...
80184301 What have I ever done?
80184302 Heh heh...
80185000 Ow!
80185100 I knew it, you dirty scoundrel!
80185101 There was something off about you from the start!
80185200 Hurry up and die! You wretched thief!
80185300 Rotten scoundrels...
80185301 Every last one of 'em...
80186000 Agh!
80186100 Enough of that.
80186101 Surely you are no highwayman.
80186200 A pity, this.
80186201 Our descent into savagery.
80186300 You've never heard?
80186301 Of the swiftness of a wanderer's fury.
80186400 Offed by a highwayman?
80186401 I must've lost my touch�
80187000 Agh!
80187100 Stop this at once.
80187101 And I will forgive you.
80187200 You'd come this far for your pillaging?
80187201 No different than a plague, your kind.
80187300 I've heard enough from you. Be gone.
80187400 All that I wanted was solitude�
95700000 <blank>
990000000 The Tarnished will soon return.
990000001 Guided by Grace once lost.
