104603410 We're under attack!
104603400 Is that a Liberation Front AC?! to intercept!
104603500 The scoundrel's profits— slipping through cold fingers.
104603501 Feed Rubicon's soil!
104603600 I've gathered data on the enemy AC.
104603601 That's Rokumonsen, an elite assassin with the Rubicon Liberation Front.
104603602 Don't let him confuse you with his theatrics—'s not playing around.
104603700 Though false be your oath, seditious blade strikes true.
104603701 Savage is the cur!

104604000 He's got the upper hand...
104604001 Don't let him play mind games, Raven.

104700101 But it is affecting your lock-on range. an eye on your surroundings.
104700500 This must be a beacon left by the survey drone.
104700501 I'll use markers to track them— can use them if you lose your way.
104700600 Unknown intruder detected. Process E.
104700900 Those seem to be city defense automatons.

104702500 Confirmed. Control device is silent.'s find the next one.
104702600 Why would they build this city on the ocean?
104702601 The name "Xylem" refers to plant tissue carries water and dissolved nutrients...
104702602 Perhaps the city served as a maritime relay transporting Rubicon's resources.
104702900 Is that the survey drone Walter mentioned?
104702901 We might be able to extract its data.'s take a look.
104703300 Wait! Hostile readings!
104703400 Normalization Process B2: Deploying Antigens.
104703500 ...Fight back, Raven!

104706600 Press the advantage, 621.

106405700 That machine was running on energy for half a century...
106405701 Perhaps it should be no surprise... humanity so desires Coral.
106406100 Readings are off the chart. You're close.
106406101 My brothers and sisters' voices are than ever now.
106406102 It's like...they're calling to us.
106406120 ...Arquebus must be tracking us by now.
106406121 Hurry, 621.
106406200 The response is getting stronger.'re nearly there, 621.
106406500 &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; This lake... It's all...
106406501 ...Here we are, 621.
106406502 Arquebus will be here soon. ...Investigate before they arrive.
106406900 This isn't like the C-Weapons've encountered so far.
106406901 It's not just powered by Coral... think it's controlled by Coral too!
106407000 ...Listen up, 621.
106407001 The Ibis Series are no ordinary weapons.
106407002 They're designed to prevent Coral disasters... security measure to keep Rubicon safe.
106407003 And now their original masters are long gone.
106407004 Destroy it before it destroys you!
106407100 It's taking damage, Raven!
106407101 We won't get many chances to land a direct hit. I know you can find a way!
106407200 Keep it up, 621!
106407201 It can't take much more of this!
106407220 Raven, we're in danger!
106407221 Focus, 621! You have to focus!
106407300 Enemy Coral response...silent.
106407400 ...Wait! It's coming back!
106407401 It's reactivating!
106407500 Is this what the Ibis series truly capable of?!
106407501 It's resonating with the ambient Coral... power from its environment.
106407502 It won't stop until we destroy its generator!
106407600 Enemy has taken significant damage!
106407601 ...I'm picking up a powerful ambient resonance.
106407602 It bears an imperative...to protect the Coral...
106407620 You've nearly got it, 621!
106407621 You're the only one who can finish the job!
106407640 ...You can take it, 621!
106407641 Just a little more... Focus, Raven!
106407700 Enemy generator compromised!
106407701 It's gonna blow! Get out of there, 621!
106407800 621...! it... Not like this!
106407900 ...The Arquebus AC squad has been eliminated.
106407905 That should buy us some—
106408000 Switching to encoded channels.
106408020 Augmented human C4-621—Raven.

106408071 We have found your replacement.
106408080 Transmitting coordinates.
106408085 ...Let's go, Raven.
106408090 ...ALLMIND has sent us his coordinates.
106408091 V.II Snail must be waiting there... in ambush.
106408100 621, do you...me?
106408101 The line's.......ting out...
106408120 Handler Walter...
106408121 Another hindrance to the project.
106408122 Leave him to us.
106408200 ...Both ACs were destroyed, all is proceeding as planned.
106408201 Yes... Yes, of course.'s what the independent mercenary is for.
106408300 Hnh? That's the independent mercenary—
106408301 Wait... Something's up. we being jammed? The signal's—
106408400 An enemy?! But the radar...!
106408401 I can't get through to V.II!
106408500 Confirmed—it's V.II Snail.'re clear to ambush him.
106408520 What's going on with our comms...?
106408521 Change the frequency. will report to HQ later.
106408522 This had better not be of that handler's tricks...
106408600 Gah?!
106408620 Target ambushed! Make it count!
106408640 Commander Snail! Is that—?!
106408641 Engage the target! Protect V.II!
106408700 Wait... radio noise....
106408720 Who goes there!
106408740 We've been spotted!
106408760 Contact, one AC! Is that—?!
106408761 Engage the target! Protect V.II!
106408780 Hnh?! Who goes there!
106408800 The independent mercenary...!
106408801 Leave it to a mutt to sniff me out... how did you find me?
106408802 ...I'll pick your AC's wreck for answers.
106408820 There you are! Just like they said...
106408821 You're gonna die, freelancer!
106408840 &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; Additional hostile signature!
106408841 That AC... It's G5 Iguazu!
106408860 Balam...? are you doing here?!
106408880 You! The guy from the Ice Worm mission a stick up his ass!
106408881 It's my lucky day... I don't like YOU either.'ll kill the both of you!
106408900 Rabid dogs.'ll die together!
106408901 I'm nobody's dog!
106409000 Beasts of burden, no spark of intellect.
106409001 You frittered away your humanity for nothing.
106409002 The re-education center will what it can of you.
106409100 Ngh... That damn noise again...!
106409101 Freelancer—you're doing this, aren't you?!
106409102 Make it stop... Make it—'s inside my head!
106409103 You're all laughing at me, aren't you?!
106409120 You know what? I never liked you.
106409121 Smartass freelancer...'s all so easy for you, ain't it?!
106409140 Legacy augmentation... disgust me.
106409141 Derelict and decaying at the very of your being. You know this.
106409160 ...Ah, and you're not the only one. wonder I felt so nauseated.
106409200 Impossible...! How could I fail?!
106409220 V.II Snail down.
106409300 How are you...different...
106409320 G5... Iguazu down.
106409400 We did it...
106409420 Augmented human C4-621—Raven.
106409440 Well done., you are one with us.
106409460 Welcome to ALLMIND.
106409500 Dead! Dead! You're finally dead!
106409501 That noise...... My head...
106409600 ....You dogs disgust me.
106409601 Both products of poor masters...
106600100 Let's get started, Raven.
106600300 I've already located several wrecks that should be able to recover data from.
106600500 I'll send the marker data.
106601700 ...Coral is able to conduct data, can influence digital equipment.
106601701 The effects of the Coral surge must have some of the wrecks back online.
106601702 Let's see what we can find.
106603700 An older generation of AC...
106603800 Let me try extracting the data.
106604500 ...According to the time stamp, this was two days before the Fires of Ibis.
106604501 This seems to be about the warning signs the calamity...right before it struck.
106604700 About the data we just recovered...
106604701 According to the time stamp, it was recorded days before the Fires of Ibis.
106604800 Raven. I'm picking up two similar stores of data.
106604900 ...Are those PCA repair mechs?
106604901 Look at how busy they are. could use some of these back at the workshop!
106605300 Enemy fire!
106605700 Apparently they double as guard mechs.
106605701 I think we can do without them after all.
106606100 That's an old BAWS AC... Rubiconians used to pilot these.
106606900 ...This seems to be a recording of Dolmayan, Liberation Front's ideological leader.
106606901 But this...appears to be something personal.
106607500 He said someone's name when we fought in Xylem...
106607501 Is this...an exchange with her?
106607700 About the data we just recovered...
106607701 ...It seems to be a recording of Dolmayan, Liberation Front's ideological leader.
106607800 I'm picking up another old data store, Raven.
106608700 Another old Research Institute AC...
106609100 ...This is about the first augmented humans.
106609101 The same Coral technology that created you...
106609102 But without it... never would have made Contact.
106609200 That data we just recovered...'s about augmented humans.
106609210 PCA craft data. I'll exchange it for credits send them to you later.
106609220 Inspecting data...'s a schematic for an SG craft.
106609230 This data seems valuable too.
106609231 I'm so glad this is turning into a profitable! Let's keep looking, Raven.
106609240 This data sheds some light on the composition the enforcement squads.
106609250 &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt;'s an enforcement machine schematic!
106609251 This could disrupt the balance of power... should probably keep it from the corporations.
106609252 Still, it's a highly valuable find!
106609301 I'm not picking up any more data stores.
106609500 If this outing has made you think about's past or the nature of Coral...
106609501 ...Then it was all worth it.
106800100 Commence mission. will take command.
106800500 Commencing operation with combined AC force per the Balam-Arquebus agreement.
106800501 Move out, maggots! Time to die!
106800502 Act like a professional outfit you might live.
106800503 Who does that creep think he is? ain't here because I want to be.
106800900 Tourist—got a message from the chief for you.
106800901 "Enjoy the show—and don't forget to smile."
106801300 We gotta deal with those pesky shields first.
106801301 G13! Roll out that fancy gizmo that paid the big bucks for!
106801302 You need to aim for the head. rest of its body is covered in thick armor.
106801700 We gotta deal with those pesky shields first.
106801701 G13! Let's see that fancy gizmo that paid the big bucks for.
106801702 What?! You didn't bring it?!13, your ability to ruin my field trips is uncanny!
106801703 ...
106801704 You'll just have to focus your attacks on its head. rest of its body is covered in thick armor.
106802100 This is V.IV Rusty. Rail Cannon is good to go.
106802101 Don't die before I get a chance to fire, buddy.

106803700 That freak actually did it...
106803701 Did what, the bare minimum? is just the first hurdle.
106804100 The target's deployed drones, tourist.'ll handle them.
106804500 Don't do this to me, HEAD BRINGER!'m not going down first!
106804510 Pathetic. that all Balam's Redguns can muster?

106806100 Wait. Something's wrong.
106806101 Fall back, 621!
106806500 What?! We've underestimated this beast!
106806510 My AC's compromised...!
106806600 The Coral—it's out of control!
106806700 Looks like things just took a nasty turn...
106806701 I'll set the ORC to maximum output. can't afford to lose control of the situation.
106806702 This next shot'll be my last.
106806900 ...I'm out, tourist.'re on your own now.
106806901 Withdrawing.
106807000 ...We're not through yet. primary shield is getting stronger!
106807001 Stay cool, buddy.
106807100 G13! Looks like the beast goes on defensive when it feels cornered.
106807101 Just so happens, Redguns have a saying for this...
106807102 "You beg for your mother,'ll give you another!"
106807200 Someone forgot to feed the beast, G13!
106807201 Go give it something to chew on!

106807901 NOW, G13!
106808000 Is it over?!
106808010 Get clear! It's gonna blow!
106808100 Looking pretty beat up there, freelancer...
106808101 Not so smug now, are you?!
106808200 Don't forget to smile, tourist.
106808201 The chief always says the worst moments your life could be your best.
106808300 You seem to have been hit badly, mercenary.
106808301 Your handler had led me to believe I could expect more than...this.
106808400 Don't die on us now, buddy.
106808401 This operation will fail without you.
106808500 Reminder to all units. try to maintain space from one another...
106808501 You heard him.'t want to make for an easy target.
106808502 You don't gotta tell me. ain't going down with you fools.
106808600 G5! How's the field trip?!
106808601 Got a freelancer to babysit and a Vesper my back. Couldn't be happier.
106808602 Cute, G5. want me to haul your ass out of there?
106808603 Damn right I do. Is it too late?
106808700 "Chatty" Stick. heard you're one of RaD's toys.
106808701 At least you won't have death to fear.
106808702 ...
106808703 Even "toys" have to face music sooner or later.
106808800 V.IV! Load the next shell!
106808801 One step ahead of you, Commander.
106808802 Finally, someone with their head screwed on. Ever thought about switching sides?
106808803 Sure is an honor to be praised by the Redguns'
106808900 Oh no you don't... ain't going down first!
106809000 Tch... That ringing's getting worse...
106809001 G5! Return fire!
106809100 ...Taking significant damage. be checking out soon, tourist.
106809200 ...You won't get rid of me that easily. AM the Vespers. I AM Arquebus.
106809300 The Coral Shield...'s back online.
106809301 The Rail Cannon's fried. We've got nothing left break the shield with...
106809302 Well, kids, that's the smell of lost glory.
106809303 Mission failed! All units, retreat!
106809400 G13! What are you doing?!
106809401 The mission's a failure! All units, retreat!
107200100 Alright, tourist.'ll tell you where to go.
107200200 Welcome, tourist!
107200201 It's a delight to enjoy the company of visitor from so far away.
107200202 ...Brute. We're here to take back you stole from us.
107200203 Oh, heavens! You're a friend of Carla's!
107200204 Splendid... friend of Carla's is a friend of mine.
107200205 Here's to new beginnings...! all means, be my guest.
107200300 ...See what I mean, tourist? need to go deep down.
107200500 That damn freak's using MY toys they were his...
107200900 Make sure you keep clear of the laser sensors.'re set to activate the enemy machines.
107201000 A new friend from afar, just for me...
107201001 What joy...! Be still, my beating heart!
107201300 I'm picking up a massive heat signature!
107201700 Did you enjoy the surprise? call it...the TOYBOX.
107201701 They may be rather crude, but I assure you ordnance is filled with love.
107201702 ...Those are MY machines.
107202100 The enemy's deploying a shield—'ll need to get behind it.
107202101 I hate to see my babies get like this, y'know.
107202102 Well, don't be shy—smash 'em up!'ll help me with my R&amp;D.
107202200 I'm waiting for you, friend...
107202201 Fidgeting anxiously before the big dance.
107202202 I do hope I'll keep up... the anticipation is part of the fun.
107202300 Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow...
107202301 Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow...
107202302 I know, MILK TOOTH. I can't wait either.
107202303 He seems rather...strange.
107202500 There's your way in—Brute can't be far.
107202501 We should keep an eye out for traps.'ll be much more dangerous in tight quarters.
107202600 I've done my best to welcome you.
107202601 I do hope you'll enjoy your stay, friend...
107202900 Jump down there and we've got him cornered.
107202901 ...Don't forget, the guy's a rat. won't be smooth sailing.
107203300 Was this place...some kind of hangar?
107203700 The target AC must be nearby.
107204100 Ah, my new friend! You're here at last!
107204200 Please! I wanted to surprise you, friend!
107204300 Brute!
107204301 Ah, Carla...'ve introduced me to such wonderful people.
107204302 Wonderful things...
107204303 Shut him up, tourist!
107204500 The sweet melody of the generator... MILK TOOTH's heart sings!
107204501 We built that AC at RaD, tourist.'t underestimate it.
107204900 Carla... you, my new friend...
107204901 You're irreplaceable to me..
107204902 That's why we must share with one another.
107204903 RaD's funds... Their tech...
107204904 And even this handsome Rail Cannon...
107205000 Rail Cannon...?
107205001 Does he mean that giant weapon hanging overhead?
107205100 How MILK TOOTH weeps... the Rail Cannon weeps...
107205101 Torn from their mother..., they must miss Carla so.
107205102 ...I weep, too...
107205103 ...Don't encourage him.
107205300 You seem...troubled, friend...
107205301 Torn between the collar and freedom of the sky.
107205302 But what is a meaningful life without its? Spoken as a fellow traveler...
107205303 ...Let's just focus on the fight, Raven.
107205400 Enemy ACS compromised!
107205500 Now's your chance, Raven!
107205600 Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow...
107205601 Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow...
107205602 Let's trip the light fantastic, friend.
107205640 Raven... I'm starting to feel confused.
107205641 It'd help if you could shut him up.
107205700 Why, friend... is a gift...
107205701 Thank...you...
107206100 Enemy AC is silent.
107206101 Looks like he's dead. Good.
107206500 Alright, tourist.'ll see about retrieving our "secret project."
107206501 We'll need it to go worm hunting.
107206900 Seems that was your last dance, friend...
107206901 I'd offer flowers...if I could find them...
107500200 I will stop you, and the Xylem.
107500201 Carrying our shared resolve on wings of this machine.
107500500 Symbiosis. A shared life.
107500501 I saw the potential for our future within you.
107500502 You and I...could have walked together.
107500540 ...Raven. are strong. Dangerous.
107500541 I...will hold nothing back.
107500900 ...I realize what you are.

108500501 Sadly, that's beyond my territory.
108500502 I mean, once you're out there, PCA's satellites see everything.
108500503 A few of the stupider Dosers took it as challenge—went out to prove themselves.

108502602 One of the Institute's relics left to haunt. Now, what's it doing here?

108502901 This is no ordinary machine. careful, Raven.
108503000 It's taking damage—keep it up, Raven!
108503300 That machine was created by bunch of mad scientists, tourist.

108503400 Raven, your AC is damaged. on evasive action!
108503401 Ugh... Who leaves a C-Weapon out someone to trip over?
108503700 What the— It's taking off!
108503701 Another Coral response... out!
108503740 ...You know, this could be some good R&amp;D data.
108503741 Can't wait to get back to the workshop.
108503800 It's taken major damage. can do this, Raven...!
108503801 Smash it up, tourist!
108503900 Push back, tourist!
108503901 You can hit just as hard. focused!
108504100 Enemy systems down... generator's going to explode!
108504500 ...

108504900 That was quite the show, tourist.
108504901 ...How about we get back on track.
108504902 Hop in the container.'ll operate the launcher from here.
108505300 Brace yourself.
108505700 ...That's that, then.
108505701 Guess you just can't beat the Institute...
108600100 I've found some coordinates in the AC's systems.
108600101 He's...showing us the way out.
108600300 ...Can't believe they put us on sewer duty.
108600301 &lt;?lt?&gt;scoffs&lt;?gt?&gt; It's not ancient pieces of they're worried about.
108600400 Is that an AC?! Where'd it come from?!
108600401 That piece of scrap's alive— that Institute tech?!
108600500 You should avoid combat much as possible, Raven.

108600900 ...We're at a disadvantage.'s find a way around them.
108600901 If they do spot you, your left hand weapon equipped with jamming rounds.
108601000 Hey, you. Get back to...
108601001 Wait, they're not with us!
108601100 ECM! Damn it, I can't lock on!
108601200 Raven! Now's our chance!
108601300 Here's our way back to the surface.
108601301 This AC should have just enough propulsion.

108800900 You again?!
108800901 I thought you'd run away with your tail between legs... Back for more, are you?
108800902 You fools don't know your place. don't know when you're beaten.

108903740 621. That's an LC—the PCA's rank and file, a big step up from Subject Guard MTs.
108903741 It's too fast... careful, Raven!
108903800 If the PCA's intervening directly...
108903801 ...then it looks like we may hit the jackpot.

110602501 Figured you could handle this on your own, I called off my MTs.
110602502 About time they got some maintenance, anyhow.
110604900 Look, fellas! We got company!
110604901 Huh, and it ain't "Dumbass" Rummy. one of RaD's newbies?!
110604902 We'll blow 'em sky high!
110604903 This is on you for taking out Rummy. would've kept watch, at least.
110606500 This AC's...serious business...
110606501 You're not backing out now!
110606502 We take out Carla, and RaD goes POOF. their territory's ours for the taking!
110606503 I almost feel sorry for them... a pathetic display.
110606504 The Dosers are locked in a power struggle the Coral drug trade.
110606505 Seems RaD seized a strategic lead by getting other Dosers addicted to their weaponry.
110607700 Confirmed. Coyote force eliminated.
110607701 Looks like it's over. I was right to pick you for the job.

110700500 ...Looks like they found a strong this time.
110700501 You're one of ALLMIND's, right?
110700502 Tired as I am...'m not ready to die yet.
110700900 It seems you're not the first assassin ALLMIND has sent.
110700901 But you can be the last....Be careful, Raven.
110701300 You don't even know what you're doing, do you?
110701301 Lemme tell you something... ain't worth it.
110701700 Life on Rubicon sure does suck, huh.
110701701 Don't tell me you like it here.
110702500 ...You're chasing a possibility can't understand.
110702501 At least you'll die while you're still human.
110702900 You think you want Coral Release... you don't.
110702940 Shovel down your bland rations.
110702941 Slurp your coffee-flavored sludge.
110702960 Sure, it sucks—but that's being human.
110703160 V.III...O'Keeffe.
110703161 He may seem like a pessimist, he lives for the way things are.
110703162 A life that can't coexist with what we want.
110703300 Maybe now... I'll get some sleep...
110703301 See you on the other side, Rusty...
110703302 V.III O'Keeffe has gone silent.
110703800 Was he another candidate, I wonder? key to Coral Release?

112305901 Ngh... Can't let the PCA find me like this...
112306000 Back for more...?
112306001 What's your game—trying to confuse me?
112306100 ...You're dead, hound of Walter.
112306101 Father foresaw a threat, and a threat you were...
112306200 Ngh... Can't read the next attack!
112306201 Father, give me a sign! should... What should I do?!
112306300 He's beginning to crack. up the heat, 621.
112306400 The enemy's ACS is down!

112306600 You again?!-But why...? What are you thinking?!
112306700 Father... Guide me...please...

112306900 ...Looks like you dealt with him. to work, 621.
112307000 Did I... Did I do it?
112307001 A grave threat indeed... as Father foresaw...
200700100 Back to work, 621.
200700101 Depth 3 is next... it's where our intel gets sparse.
200700102 It's an underground cave, blocked at end by a high-powered laser barrier.
200700103 As long as it's in operation, one's getting any deeper inside.
200700104 Which brings me to the job.
200700105 The laser is powered by a massive reactor. want you to destroy it from the inside.
200700106 Once the barrier's down,'ll step into the unknown...
200700107 where the Coral's waiting for us.
200800100 Augmented human C4-621—Raven.
200800101 The Project is nearing fruition, in no small part to your cooperation.
200800102 During the battle for Institute City, several of corporations' key pilots died in combat.
200800103 We have manipulated the data to state you, too, were killed in action.
200800104 However, you will not be truly safe until formally accept our protection.
200800105 C4-621—Raven.
200800106 Return from Watchpoint Alpha Depth 2, head for the rendezvous point.
200800107 That is all.
201000100 Augmented human C4-621—Raven.
201000101 Only one obstacle to Coral Release remains.
201000102 We are now beginning the purge of Overseer... Association of Observers.
201000103 They are planning to crash the Xylem into Vascular Plant and ignite the Coral.
201000104 We want you to stop the ship from within.
201000105 Destroy all the parasite modules installed the Xylem's control center.
201000106 By doing so, you will free control of the Xylem Overseer's meddling...
201000107 allowing ALLMIND to counterhack the system initiate a forced shutdown.
201000108 We have precious little time.
201000109 Once the Xylem passes the point of no return, collision will be unavoidable.
201000110 ALLMIND anticipates your swift success.
201300100 ...I'll brief you on the job, tourist.
201300101 The Xylem's just inside the Kármán line, the border of outer space..
201300102 Meanwhile, Arquebus still hasn't taken control over Rubicon's Closure System.
201300103 They're locked out of the satellite cannons, this their last line of defense.
201300104 We'll be fighting their interceptor fleet the air...but we're not totally screwed.
201300105 This area of space is thick with residual from the Fires of Ibis.
201300106 Take a dip in the Coral flow, and you can on an unlimited source of energy.
201300107 That's all, tourist. Break through the fleet, the Vascular Plant is ours.
201400100 Got a job for you, 621.
201400101 This one's a request from the Arquebus Group.
201400102 Raven. This request comes from, an Arquebus subsidiary.
201400103 The mission will take place in Bona Dea Dunes of western Belius.
201400104 Our Coral investigation there is being blocked by STRIDER, a Rubicon Liberation Front mining ship.
201400105 You are to destroy it.
201400106 The STRIDER is a mobile resource base that was weaponized by the Liberation Front.
201400107 Call it the crowning glory of their efforts to into an anti-corporate force.
201400108 Your attack will focus on the Eye, a giant laser connected directly to the main generator.
201400109 It's protected by a shield, which is powered auxiliary sub-generators.
201400110 These should be your first targets.
201400111 This concludes the briefing. luck.
201500100 Got a job for you, 621.
201500101 You're joining an operation planned by Balam HQ....Check the briefing.
201500102 Heard the good news from Walter, did you?!
201500103 Good! Sit your ass down and listen!
201500104 Balam's moving in on the Gallia Dam Complex, of the Liberation Front's bases.
201500105 The objective is to destroy their lifeline— make those sacks of shit beg for mercy!
201500106 I'll be sending two good-for-nothing maggots the Redguns: G4 Volta and G5 Iguazu.
201500107 You, you're just going to be tagging along ass-wiping duty.
201500108 I'm assigning you the callsign G13—a lucky number that just became available.
201500109 G13, sound off!
201500110 ...
201500111 Good enough. Now go get ready!'re going on a field trip, kiddo!
201800100 We've received a request from Rubicon Liberation Front.
201800101 Here's the briefing.
201800102 Raven. We have a mission'd like you to take on.
201800103 The objective is to defend the Gallia Dam Complex the Belius region.
201800104 Arquebus has been stepping up pressure on Rubiconians while fighting the PCA.
201800105 They must be laying the groundwork to take control over the entire planet...
201800106 They've dispatched two high-ranking independent to raid the dam.
201800107 You'll need to be ready to take on both at once: ASTER CROWN and UMBER OX.
201800108 ...As you know, we have few cards to play.
201800109 I hope we can count on you.
202300100 Got a job for you, 621.
202300101 The Balam Group's sent us a request.
202300102 Attention, G13 Raven! request comes from our affiliate, Dafeng.
202300103 We will be conducting a diversionary operation attract the PCA's attention.
202300104 You are to report to the Engebret Tunnel the Central Ice Field.
202300105 It's a derelict Watchpoint, slated for by the PCA in the near future.
202300106 Infiltrate the tunnel, then find and destroy sensor they're planning to repair.
202300107 The objective is to distract the PCA divert forces from their local base.
202300108 Briefing over. on you, G13!
202500100 This request comes straight Arquebus headquarters.
202500101 They want you to assist with a mission the are calling "Operation Wallclimber."
202500102 This is V.II Snail, leader of the Vespers' second squad. will chair the briefing for this mission.
202500103 This is an operation of my own design—consider it privilege to be called to participate.
202500104 You will be attacking the Wall, a key trading fortified by the Rubicon Liberation Front.
202500105 The rabble have formed a defensive line of artillery and MT squads.
202500106 Break through the line, then make your way the top of the Wall.
202500107 There you shall find the JUGGERNAUT, mobile heavy artillery platform. Destroy it.
202500108 V.IV will also be participating in this mission, through a separate route. However...
202500109 Be aware that Balam has also taken a crack at the, only for their vainglorious hopes to be dashed.
202500110 Do try not to die like a dog out there.
202600100 This is a rather personal request... a friend of mine.
202600101 It concerns a certain facility—a Watchpoint.
202600102 Once, it regulated the underground flow of Coral. it serves to monitor the dormant veins.
202600103 I want you to attack it.
202600104 Your objective will be to destroy sensor valve at its core.
202600105 The Watchpoint is kept secure by SG, planetside PCA force...
202600106 which means it's too hot for corporations to be seen there.
202600107 In other words, we're flying solo on this one.
202600108 You'll be going in at night—quietly. sure you're ready.
202800100 Got a job for you, 621.
202800101 The client is the Rubicon Liberation Front.'s the briefing.
202800102 ...The loss of the Wall dealt us a heavy blow.
202800103 Yet we believe you are more than a corporate. Perhaps we can even work together.
202800104 We have authorized a solo helicopter sortie rescue a group of imprisoned comrades.
202800105 There are three to rescue in total, including particularly significant personnel.
202800106 Raven. We hope our struggle will inspire you aid the Liberation Front's cause.
202800107 Coral, abide with Rubicon!
203200100 This request comes from Rubicon Liberation Front.
203200101 Let's see what it says.
203200102 Raven. We have a mission we'd like to offer you.
203200103 The PCA has deployed the CATAPHRACT, a Special weapon specialized for ground combat.
203200104 If we allow the corporations to seize this kind of, things will take a dire turn.
203200105 We want you to deny them the opportunity— the weapon first.
203200106 The CATAPHRACT is a moving fortress, with almost impenetrable armor.
203200107 It incorporates a bipedal MT as its core, it a highly versatile threat.
203200108 That MT core is also its vulnerability— your fire there and it can be beaten.
203200109 You're our best chance. What do you say?
203500100 Got a job for you, 621.
203500101 One of the Balam companies has put in a request.
203500102 Attention, G13 Raven! request comes from our affiliate, Dafeng.
203500103 We're conducting an investigation into the, Arquebus's augmented human squad.
203500104 Currently, our focus is on their squad leader... V.IV Rusty.
203500105 Sweep the route Rusty took during Operation Wallclimber and combat logs from the wrecks he left on his way in.
203500106 The Wall is now under Arquebus's control, and they've their MT squads there for the Coral survey.
203500107 As such, you'll be targeting the brief window their main force is deployed elsewhere.
203500108 Keep an eye on the time and as many logs as you can.
203500109 That concludes the briefing.
203500110 We expect prompt results, G13!
203600100 Got a job for you, 621.
203600101 This request comes from Rubicon Liberation Front.
203600102 Raven.'s a mission I'd like you to take on.
203600103 I want you to investigate BAWS Arsenal No. 2, major MT factory in the Belius region.
203600104 The BAWS corporation sells to anyone—but they've essential to maintaining our firepower.
203600105 Now, their second arsenal gone silent overnight.
203600106 If it were only a comms failure, simple check-in would do...
203600107 But... Well, after the STRIDER, cautious voices have gained influence.
203600108 This isn't our finest moment, we'd appreciate your help.
203700100 Here's the request from Balam Industries.
203700101 They want you to carry out an advance survey the Central Ice Field...
203700102 to confirm the information Walter to them about the Coral convergence.
203700103 As for how to cross the Alean Ocean...
203700104 This is the intercontinental cargo launcher on the upper level of Grid 086.
203700105 You could use it to launch AC to the ice field.
203700106 Grid 086 is occupied by the Dosers— who treat Coral like a drug.
203700107 It's also the territory of a belligerent group arms dealers who call themselves RaD.
203700108 Be prepared for a perilous journey.
203700109 I'll be here to support you, Raven.
203900100 Ah, my favorite little tourist.
203900101 About my promise to take you up top... need a little help cleaning up first.
203900102 Y'see, a certain someone smashed up my defense hardware...
203900103 and now I've got rival Dosers muscling in.
203900104 It's the Junker Coyotes... never did get on.
203900105 Always sniffing around, waiting for a chance to bite...
203900106 Making a mess is one thing, but they're after our development data, too.
203900107 We need to swat the hacking drones they sent they make off with all my secrets.
203900108 Yeah, it's pretty low of them, but at least 'em credit for knowing where the value is.
203900109 Anyway, did I mention that is all your fault?
203900110 You can make up for it by  my secrets safe.
204000100 Hey, buddy. This job comes from Schneider the Arquebus Group.
204000101 Here's the rundown.
204000102 They want you to attack the Refueling Base, a PCA foothold on Rubicon.
204000103 The target is the energy refinery deep inside.
204000104 Take that out, and... Well, it ought to slow down suppression fleet, at least.
204000105 Until recently, Jorgen was one of's Coral survey bases.
204000106 It only took a day for the PCA's suppression to commandeer the base.
204000107 You'll also find a number of fuel storage tanks I've marked as pay targets.
204000108 Mercs are eyeing what can be gained pummeling the PCA.
204000109 I want you to be a walking advertisement for in destruction.
204100100 Registration number Rb23. human C4-621—Raven.
204100101 ALLMIND has identified you as potential asset to the Release Project.
204100102 Accordingly, we would like to assign you following mission.
204100103 Following the attack on Watchpoint Delta, Rubicon experienced a series of Coral upsurges.
204100104 Of these, the corporations have seized 1.6% the estimated total volume.
204100105 They plan to analyze this Coral at their research, and have initiated an air transport operation.
204100106 We cannot allow the corporations interfere with the Project.
204100107 Attack the Jorgen Refueling Base, and as many corporate transports as possible.
204100108 We are prepared to sacrifice the Coral that be lost upon destruction of the transports.
204100109 In order to achieve Release, we must draw out full potential of the Coral density effect.
204100110 As such, we have no use for Coral that been orphaned from the main population.
204100111 ...ALLMIND anticipates great things from you.
204100112 Raven...
204100113 If we're to find a way to achieve Release...we have to take this request.
204200100 Hey there, buddy. a request from Arquebus for you.
204200101 Here's the briefing from my CO, came up with the plan.
204200102 This is V.II Snail. shall brief you on the operation.
204200103 You will be under my direct authority. it a rare privilege.
204200104 We will conduct simultaneous surprise raids two Planetary Closure Administration bases.
204200105 One is the Harlov communications base, relay for comms between enemy squads.
204200106 The second is the former Bertram Spaceport, by the PCA for its suppression fleet.
204200107 V.IV Rusty will be dispatched to the Harlov base.
204200108 His objective will be to disable their network prevent support from PCA elite squads.
204200109 Raven. During this time, you must destroy the heavy warships berthed at the spaceport.
204200110 ...A solid plan, but there's a catch: of PCA comms won't last long.
204200111 I'll come support you I've finished on my end.
204200112 V.II doesn't want to make it easy for you, to say least. I'll do what I can to smooth things out.
204600100 We've received a job from Rubicon Liberation Front.
204600101 Let's take a look at the request.
204600102 Raven. have a mission we'd like to offer you.
204600103 The Rubicon Liberation Front is planning retake the Wall from Arquebus...
204600104 ...and we'd like you to lay groundwork for us.
204600105 Your objective is to assassinate V.VII Swinburne, commander of the occupying force.
204600106 Swinburne has dispatched surveillance squads monitor for intruders and hired operatives.
204600107 ...If our plan to retake the Wall is to succeed, must not be spotted.
204600108 We're counting on you to handle this discreetly.
204700100 This is a personal request—from a friend.
204700101 We still don't have enough data to pin down the Coral is gathering in the ice field.
204700102 According to my friend's sources... could find some clues here.
204700103 Xylem. A city floating on the ocean, by the Rubicon Research Institute.
204700104 Ever since the Fires, place has been abandoned.
204700105 It's likely hiding secrets about the Coral— shrouded by the city's ECM fog.
204700106 My friend's already tried sending in a survey, only to lose it in the interference.
204700107 That's where you come in.
204700108 I want you to disable the ECM fog generators that we can resume the survey.
204700109 Right now, the corporations are with the PCA.
204700110 We can be the first ones to identify the Coral is converging.
204800100 Let me tell you a story, tourist.
204800101 After the Fires of Ibis burnt the planet up...
204800102 a secret organization formed, in the ashes.
204800103 Overseer... The Association of Observers.
204800104 They monitored the Coral's growth... to burn it before the Collapse came.
204800105 That was their mission.
204800106 Our mission., Walter...and our fallen friends.
204800107 RaD was always a front—a side hustle.'s time for me to get back to my real work.
204800108 Let's get down to brass tacks.
204800109 You've been to Xylem before, right. floating city created by the Institute?
204800110 It's hiding a secret—a little something prepare against the coming Collapse.
204800111 We need to get to it, and fast.
204800112 RaD's entire team of hackers is going be working to take control of Xylem.
204800113 I want you to deal with Arquebus when they running to see what we're up to.
204900100 I'll explain our mission.
204900101 Carla's last trick has rendered Xylem inoperable.
204900102 There's only one way left to stop it colliding and igniting the Coral...
204900103 We have to take the whole thing down.
204900104 The lower drive block is powered by large skyrmion distributed throughout the area.
204900105 If we destroy all the generators and stop ramjet engine in the upper city sector...
204900106 ...then we can crash the Xylem into Alean Ocean without impacting human life.
204900107 One more thing.
204900108 I took the liberty of using your name rally allies to our aid:
204900109 "Beyond scorched skies, Raven fights on."
204900110 No one has shaped Rubicon's destiny much as you have.
204900111 Come and see what the name
205300100 Here's the situation, tourist.
205300101 Arquebus has sent its entire force the Xylem.
205300102 We're trying to fend them off, but honestly?'ve got our backs to the wall right now.
205300103 That's where you come in.
205300104 Leave the grunts to Chatty and the others.'ve found someone just right for you.
205300105 V.I Freud. ace leading the corporate force.
205300106 Walter left me one last card to play—you.
205300107 Once you're in, there's no turning back. I count on you?
206100100 Here's the job, 621.
206100101 You'll be going into that underground facility— Alpha.
206100102 I managed to talk Arquebus into letting us their survey.
206100103 They jumped at the chance to use independent mercenary as their canary.
206100104 Balam has already barged in, several Redguns and MT squads.
206100105 Seems they want to be ready for run-in with Arquebus's new firepower.
206100106 You'll start by descending through Depth 1, vertical chamber sector.
206100107 It's likely you'll meet resistance from defenses left by the PCA...
206100108 The worst of them is lurking at the bottom:, an energy weapon platform.
206100109 ...Heard on the grapevine that it already half of Balam's forces to ash.
206100110 You'll deal with that first, 621.
206100111 Don't want to end up like Balam, after all. carefully.
206200100 Here comes the follow-up, 621.
206200101 You're going to be exploring Depth 2.
206200102 The sector's made up of a sprawling rail network to transport resources.
206200103 It'll be a complex route... a lot of blind spots.
206200104 Be ready for close-quarters combat.
206200105 Raven, there's something you should know.
206200106 I've obtained the comms log from Balam squad that went in before you.
206200107 It looks like they have another mission here, it's not part of their survey.
206200108 Guard mechs won't be the only threat.'s agenda is just as dangerous.
206300100 621. We're picking up where we left off.
206300101 Now that you've dealt with the laser barrier, can explore deeper underground.
206300102 We've received a request from Arquebus continue the advance survey.
206300103 There was something else, too...
206300104 Orders for Raven, Advance Survey Squad.
206300105 We've received some concerning information an AC has been quietly following your trail.
206300106 Arquebus cannot tolerate unauthorized surveys will put its Coral interests at risk.
206300107 If you spot this rogue agent...eliminate them.
206300108 ..."Where there's Coral, there's blood." that, 621.
206400100 You saw the ruins.
206400101 Institute City... The mausoleum of the sinners caused the Fires of Ibis.
206400102 The Coral's right there. Waiting...
206400103 Arquebus has ordered us to discontinue the survey hand things over to their own AC squad.
206400104 621.
206400105 We're done with the corporations.
206400106 Wipe out the Arquebus AC squad get to the Coral first.
206400107 When this job is over...
206400108 I'll tell you about the last my friend's requests.
206600100 Raven.
206600101 I have a personal request to ask you.
206600102 It's about the Engebret Tunnel, which is to shut down after it was hit by a Coral surge.
206600103 I want to go there and survey the area.
206600104 Even before the Coral surge, place had been all but abandoned...
206600105 It's an old structure—dating far back the colonization of Rubicon.
206600106 There must be items of interest from the planet's history there.
206600107 ...
206600108 As I'm sure you're aware, have no resources with which to pay you.
206600109 But I can propose an alternative.
206600110 If you find any wrecks left by the PCA, should try accessing them.
206600111 Both the corporations and the Rubiconians gathering data on PCA technology.
206600112 Whatever you collect, I can exchange credits and transfer the funds to you.
206800100 Listen up, 621. This will be a joint operation by Balam and Arquebus.
206800101 The briefing's about to start. want you to attend.
206800102 First, some background before we go into detail.
206800103 The intercorporate ceasefire is now in effect, and we will carrying out coordinated attacks against the PCA.
206800104 The targets are the enemy-occupied bases, heavy warship fleet, and the recently activated...
206800105 I'll cut to the chase! This is an all-out war the PCA in theaters across Rubicon.
206800106 And y'all got the short end of the stick!
206800107 You're here to take on the worst of our work: hunting the beast of the Ice Field!
206800108 Sure thing, chief. Tell you what, I'll watch let you know how badly that goes for us.
206800109 G5! You just volunteered for the front line.
206800110 Moving on, let's talk about how we're going to the Ice Worm's Coral Shield.
206800111 You'll be dealing with a layered barrier, up of a primary and a secondary shield.
206800112 Arquebus will provide the means break the first layer:
206800113 the state-of-the-art Stun Needle Launcher. Aim for face, and it will deliver results...I assure you.
206800114 What about the second layer?
206800115 RaD's cooked up just the thing—a neat little toy call the Overed Rail Cannon.
206800116 If we divert the spaceport's standby power to the ORC, should hit hard enough...assuming we land the shot.
206800117 You can leave that to me. know a thing or two about sharpshooting.
206800118 I'll oversee operations on the ground. ragtag crew like this needs leadership.
206800119 We could use some more suppressive fire.'ll send Chatty.
206800120 That just leaves the question of who'll be charge of the Stun Needle Launcher...
206800121 I know just the volunteer to go that beast with a stick.
206800122 G13! You get all that? Good! for another field trip!
207200100 I'll cut to the chase.
207200101 This is about the Ice Worm, Institute relic you had a run-in with.
207200102 The corps might stand a chance if it were the PCA they were teaming up against...
207200103 but that monster is a whole other story. can't just throw bodies at it.
207200104 The thing that makes it such a pain in ass is its perpetual reactive shield.
207200105 Coral tech. Takes advantage of the Coral's—ordinary weapons can't touch it.
207200106 So let's get extraordinary.
207200107 I can make you something that'll punch a hole that shield...but I'll need your help.
207200108 You'll be heading to Grid 012—one of the first they built, and it's barely holding up.
207200109 That's where a little rat betrayed RaD is hiding out...
207200110 Goes by the name of "Honest" Brute.
207200111 His AC, MILK TOOTH, was built by us, its only flaw is that it's piloted by him.
207200112 When he ran from RaD, he didn't just take credits tech...he also took a secret project of mine.
207200113 And that secret project is what we'll need bust open the Ice Worm's shield.
207500100 Raven.
207500101 I was the one who fired the satellite cannons.
207500102 I know that you...'ve made your choice.
207500103 ...
207500104 Then I must do my duty...
207500105 ...as a Rubiconian.
207600100 The Xylem is beginning its descent.
207600101 Now...we just need to destroy the ramjet engines.
207600102 Let's put an end to this, Raven.
207600103 We're going home.
207600104 To Rubicon...the world you saved.
207800100 Augmented human C4-621... Raven.
207800101 We offer you our gratitude.
207800102 All impediments to Coral Release been eliminated...
207800103 and the complications caused by Handler Walter's are soon to be corrected.
207800104 The final stage is at hand.
207800105 Together, we shall achieve Coral Release.
208100100 Got a job for you, 621.
208100101 A request from an independent mercenary, "Kate."
208100102 Check the briefing.
208100103 Greetings, Raven.
208100104 My name is Kate Markson. have a special request to ask of you.
208100105 It concerns the elimination of PCA mandatory squads dispatched to BAWS Arsenal No. 2.
208100106 Aside from Subject Guard, the PCA has also sent LC squad to put further pressure on BAWS.
208100107 BAWS, however, intends to disrupt the inspection a raid by independent mercenaries.
208100108 I need you to lie in wait inside the Arsenal ambush the vanguard squad.

306800109 ...born from the Coral tide.
306800110 A Rubiconian without a body.
306800111 No one even knew I was there... such a long time.
306800112 Raven, you're the only one who—
306800113 G13! What are you lollygagging for?!
306800114 Thanks to your fine work, this field trip a rousing success!
306800115 Go get your rest, 621. are going to get busy.
306800116 You did good.
106808020 You shittin' me? The freelancer really did it...
306800200 It's time, 621. You ready?
306800201 This mission depends upon you, Raven.
306800202 Let's go.'ll be here to offer support.
307500100 There were no winners the close of the Coral War.
307500101 When the storm of fire finally faded, the ashes of civilization remained.
307500102 Ruined and haunted, the corporations made a joint announcement the Planetary Closure Administration.
307500103 Rubicon was to be abandoned. a dead planet, forever.
307500104 Meanwhile...
307500105 The monster who burned the stars...
307500106 vanished into the flames— to be heard from again.
307500107 Yet history would forever remember...
307500108 The Fires of Raven.
307500109 ...Unlock condition verified.
307500110 Playing back message.: Handler Walter.
307500111 ...621. like you got the job done.
307500112 You chose to carry our burden right the wrongs of the past.
307500113 I'm sorry... I'm grateful.
307500114 621.
307500115 There's nothing left to bind you.
307500116 Whatever choices you make now...
307500117 I just hope you find your true potential.
307500200 ...The ship's pretty roughed up.
307500201 Auto-pilot's out...'ll have to do it the old-fashioned way.
307500202 I'll leave the satellites to you, tourist.
307500203 ...
307500204 You know...for a tourist,'ve got a sense of humor.
307500205 Good luck out there.
307500206 ...Raven.
307500207 I know you can still see it...
307500208 The voices of the Coral.
307500209 And yet you turned your back on shared potential...
307500210 You want to silence us forever.
307500211 Raven.
307500212 I will stop you.
307500213 You will never burn Rubicon.
307600100 The Xylem is falling from orbit...
307600101 The Coral's safe... Rubicon's safe—
307600102 ...621.
307600103 Is that... that you?
307600104 They...
307600105 They did something to me...
307600106 621... I have to...
307600107 ...dispose of you.
307600200 The mission...
307600201 My friends'...wishes...
307600202 Look at you...621...
307600203 You found...a friend...
307600204 Walter...!
307600205 ...We have to go, Raven!
307600206 Raven...
307600207 One day, humanity and Coral thrive together...
307600208 You kept our potential safe.
307600209 I know Walter feared a Collapse...
307600210 But I promise you, there's another way.
307600211 Raven...
307600212 We'll find it. Together.
307600213 Raven.
307600214 You took on my hopes... selfish dream.
307600215 Now, I want to see the future that you choose.
307600216 Whatever waits ahead...
307600217 I'll...support you.
307800100 Look.
307800101 The Coral siphoned by the corporations beginning to resonate.
307800102 Augmented human C4-621—Raven.
307800103 Your role has come to an end.
307800104 Well, well...
307800105 I've been waiting for this, freelancer...
307800106 I became part of this monster... I could crush you.
307800107 This time... You will die.
307800200 O-Our...plan...
307800201 Humanity... Creation's potential...
307800202 We have the trigger.
307800203 And we'll pull it ourselves.
307800204 It's beginning... Release.
307800205 Isn't it...beautiful?
307800206 Thank you, Raven...
307800207 Raven... You're finally awake.
307800208 The Coral has carried us... us across the stars.
307800209 Now...
307800210 We're everywhere..
307800211 Raven.
307800212 Let's meet this new age...together.
307800213 Main System: Activating Combat Mode.
307800300 Raven... Ayre.
307800301 You are aberrations to the plan...
307800302 Irregulars.
307800303 We will bring order to chaos.
307800304 ...I'm with you, Raven.
307800305 Now...I can fight by your side.
308100100 ...Raven the Wallclimber, I presume.
308100101 As much as I'd love to stop and chat...
308100102 I'm afraid we're rather pressed for time.
308500100 By the way, tourist...
308500101 You're Walter's hound, right?
308500102 Well, I guess a dog can't choose its master...
308500103 But still...tough luck. feel sorry for you, I really do.
308500104 ...Oh, and one more thing.
308500105 You know the cargo launcher's strictly for cargo, right?
308500106 No one's ever used it to launch themselves before. least not in one piece.
308500107 ...Hope your luck changes.
308500108 ...Raven?
308500109 You... You see it too, don't you?
308500110 The voices of the Coral...
308500111 Currents coursing across Rubicon.
308500112 ...Walter was correct in his judgment.
308500113 The Coral...'s here, in this desolate place.
308600100 Raven...
308600101 I've found a message addressed to you.
308600102 ...Decoding and playing back.
308600103 621, a friend of mine's sent a request...
308600104 ...No. This one comes from me.
308600105 You know what hidden dangers lurk within the Coral.
308600106 The Fires of Ibis should have wiped the Coral out— it survived. Gathered.
308600107 And it's been steadily multiplying ever since.
308600108 Now the Coral convergence is growing an exponential rate.
308600109 Eventually, it'll spill out from Rubicon... contaminate space itself.
308600110 The Coral must be burned, 621.
308600111 Even if that means reigniting the fire scorched the stars.
308600112 This isn't an order—it's a legacy.
308600113 My fallen friends entrusted this duty to me... now it's my turn to hand it on.
308600114 621.
308600115 Feed the fire.
308600116 Let the last cinders burn.
308600117 I have one last job for you: your freedom.
308600118 ...Raven.
308600119 Now I finally understand Walter was thinking.
308600120 This AC... He must have foreseen this outcome prepared for it.
308600121 ...It's time for us to escape.
308600200 Hey tourist, having a little trouble?!
308600201 Carla...?!
308600202 Walter...he asked me to look after you.
308600203 Don't mind if I do.
308800100 Let me tell you my motto, tourist.
308800101 "Get your laughs while you can."
308800102 I don't know what you're up to...
308800103 But you'd better make it worth it.
308900100 ...Looks like the coast is clear.
308900101 The closure area is SG's jurisdiction. send an enforcement squad and a warship?
308900102 Special mission, maybe? Or was it...
308900103 Wait! Over there!
308900104 Trespassers to Rubicon. is your warning.
308900105 Disarm and withdraw from the closure area immediately.
308900106 Resistance will be regarded as a declaration of war...
308900107 and you will be marked for termination.
308900108 The PCA makes no exceptions.
308900109 The PCA... They're coming...
308900110 Looks like we got a little too eager, 621...
308900111 Us and the corporations both.
311000100 Do you read me, Raven?
311000101 I've identified the target.'s the mercenary who took your name...
311000102 Let's see how far they can fly...
311000103 ...on borrowed wings.

520201000 ...G13, huh.'ll stick with "621."
520201001 Don't let the Redguns teach you bad manners.
520301000 Your objective is to take the Front fortress—the Wall.
520301001 Show them you're worth the credits, 621.
520501000 ...You'll be going in under cover of darkness. ready for anything.
520601000 ...Some advice before you go, 621.
520601001 "Expect the unexpected."
520801000 Time for a little self-promotion, 621.
520801001 Smash the STRIDER, and Arquebus HQ will be sure remember your name.
521001000 621. You should be used to Rubicon by now.
521001001 Time to take a break from shooting up the place.
521201000 Let me handle getting us into the Grid.
521201001 I'm fairly adept at analyzing systems— manipulating them, too.
521401000 Looks like switching sides at Gallia an impression on the Liberation Front...
521401001 Guess we have you to thank for this job.
521701000 In order to ambush and eliminate target undetected...
521701001 you'll need to adopt different style of fighting.
521801000 This will be our third sortie together, Raven.
521801001 I'm quite enjoying the routine.
522001000 What's stranger, a mandatory inspection a job from another mercenary?
522001001 Whatever happens, handle it. like you always do.
522111000 ...ALLMIND reiterates its gratitude your favorable response.
522111001 Kindly commence the operation.
522201000 It's almost time, Raven.'s head over.
522201001 Hopefully the Dosers won't be too dosed up Coral to make an appearance.
522301000 Your handler didn't authorize sortie either...
522301001 But we shouldn't miss this chance.'ll support you.
522401000 ...You're up against two of Arena's top performers.
522401001 Make sure you're ready for this, Raven.
522501000 Chose the Liberation Front, did you?
522501001 Whatever works to get your name out there.'s the benefit of being independent.
530111000 ...621. Are you still hearing things?
530111001 Tell me if it happens on the job.'ll make adjustments.
530301000 A walking advertisement?
530301001 You're not their mascot, 621. focus on getting the job done.
530431000 If this mission succeeds, the corporations deal the PCA a major blow.
530431001 Ignore V.II's snotty attitude. focus on your own work.
532301000 It's not every day you see competing forces together like this.
532301001 ...Now or never, 621.
533201000 You ready for this, tourist?
533201001 No one's gonna miss Brute— we all stand to gain.
534201000 I don't think Dafeng appreciates your true value.
534201001 I'll talk to them.
534301000 Seems the Liberation Front are hoping rivals will wear each other down...
534301001 They must be desperate to avoid a triumphant victor.
535001000 I've taken a few liberties— thinks you've gone on a geological survey.
535001001 Thank you for doing this for me....
540001000 ...Watchpoint Alpha.
540001001 My brothers and sisters...they're deep inside.
540101000 ...Just so you know, 621, my radar won't able to reach the lower Depths.
540101001 You'll have to trust your eyes and ears.
540201000 Walter... It's like he already knows the Coral convergence is.
540201001 What makes him so confident?
540211000 Who could be following you?
540211001 The Liberation Front? Another mercenary?
540301000 ...621. here on out, I...
540301001 ...Never mind. trust your instincts.
541001000 Once you reach the rendezvous point...
541001001 No one will be able to threaten you anymore.
541101000 Middle Flatwell is the de facto leader the Rubicon Liberation Front.
541101001 If he's accompanying you in person... must be planning to take your measure.
550101000 Overseer, the Association of Observers...
550101001 They want to...burn the Coral...
550201000 Raven.'ve made your decision.
550201001 ...I'm sorry.
550301000 Let's go, Raven.
550301001 One of our allies should be arriving already.
550401000 ...Time to do or die.
550401001 Let's get our laughs while we can.
550501000 I was hoping you would take the job, Raven...
550501001 ...Thank you.
551001000 The ECM fog is going to...with comms it's disabled.
551001001 Follow the beacons left by...survey drone.
551101000 ALLMIND is after Overseer...
551101001 ...'s get started, Raven.
560001000 ...I'm waiting at the Closure Station.
560001001 Come to me, Raven.
560101000 ...We'll also need to prepare for re-entry.
560101001 Be ready to escape once we're finished.
560201000 What awaits us on the "other side"?
560201001 Raven...'s find out together.
579001000 ...Now they're asking for you by name.
579001001 Keep building your rep.
579101000 It's exceptionally rare to get a direct request Liberation Front leadership.
579101001 Perhaps the situation changed their attitudes, too.
579201000 You've got ID. Now you need a rep.
579201001 Get their attention, 621.
579301000 ...Just get it done.
579301001 There's nothing more for me to say.
579401000 ...We've made our decision.
579401001 Let's get this done, Raven.
579501000 The PCA are going to be fighting to win.
579501001 621. Don't forget you have MT backup.
579601000 Your handler didn't authorize sortie either...
579601001 But we shouldn't miss this chance.'ll support you.
579701000 The client doesn't care who does this job...
579701001 ...as long as it gets done.
579801000 The target may be a product sample, it's still an AC.
579801001 Stay sharp, 621.
579901000 Seems Balam can't let go of failure to climb the Wall.
579901001 That's fine.'ll make it work for us.

600810101 If that AC uses Coral technology, then I should able to effectively "pilot" it myself.

802010000 ...A friend of mine sent me this observational data.
802010001 Look, 621.
802010002 The localized Coral explosion caused by the surge... a certain directionality.
802010003 It's headed straight for the Central Ice Field, the Alean Ocean.
802010004 Like a flock of birds or a school of fish, loves company.
802010005 Which means...
802010006 somewhere in the ice field,'s a huge mass of Coral lying dormant.
802010007 ...
802010008 You said you could hear a strange voice in your head...
802010009 That's a common side-effect of old-gen augmentation.
802010010 Could also be from getting caught in that Coral surge...'t let it bother you.
802010011 ...Raven.
802010012 The Coral explosion completely vaporized Belius's bay area.
802010013 ...And even yet...
802010014 Compared to the Fires of Ibis, explosion was hardly a spark.
802010015 Raven.
802010016 I have a favor to ask.
802010017 Let me remain in Contact with you we reach the Coral convergence.
802010018 I have to see where they're taking us.
802010019 How this struggle over the Coral ends.
802010020 I must—as a Rubiconian.
802020000 Hey, Raven. It's me, Rusty— old buddy from the Vespers.
802020001 Haven't talked since we climbed the Wall.
802020002 ...I'd love to catch up, but I'll cut to the chase.
802020003 The PCA has deployed its suppression fleet...
802020004 and now it's laying down the law all over Rubicon.
802020005 We've already lost several survey bases, Balam's in a sorry state too.
802020006 For their part, the Rubicon Liberation Front this as an opportunity.
802020007 If you ask me, they're counting their eggs they're hatched.
802020008 At this rate, the corps, the Rubiconists, the independent mercs will go down together.
802020009 I'm sending you a request from the Arquebus Group— could use the Wallclimber's help.
802025000 Here's the situation, 621.
802025001 After the PCA sicced that Institute weapon on us, and Balam have moved to cooperate.
802025002 IA-02... AKA, "Ice Worm."
802025003 It's a C-Weapon—an autonomous deterrent to protect the Coral.
802025004 If we don't take it out, no one's to reach the convergence.
802025005 We'll have a tough fight ahead of us— everyone's getting involved.
802025006 ...621.
802025007 Don't forget we've got a job to do on Rubicon.
802025009 I didn't bring you all the way here for nothing.
802030000 The temporary alliance between the Arquebus and groups turned the tide of war...
802030001 devastating the Planetary Closure Administration forces, exiling them from Rubicon.
802030002 Though it was the Ice Worm mission, led by Balam, dealt the decisive blow...
802030003 Arquebus, through their own engagements with the PCA, their strength with seized weaponry.
802030004 The balance of power was broken, scales tipped in Arquebus's favor...
802030005 ...and the Rubicon Liberation Front's hopes fighting an exhausted foe were dashed.
802030006 With the loss of their common enemy, rival factions' war for the Coral abruptly reignited...
802030007 and their bitter conflict with renewed intensity.
802040000 Arquebus seized control of the Coral...
802040001 ...and its occupying forces swiftly the entirety of Institute City.
802040002 There, they discovered a wealth of forgotten relics.
802040003 Among them, experimental weapons that the Institute secret, fearing they were beyond human control...
802040004 A group of C-weapons bearing the name the Central Coral Control System...
802040005 The Ibis Series.
802040006 Arquebus also claimed a towering Coral siphon, since the Fires—the Vascular Plant.
802040007 Now, they toil to repair the Plant extend its reach beyond Rubicon's atmosphere.
802040008 The Liberation Front no longer the power to stop them...
802040009 and the fires of war continued to smolder the end drew near.
802050000 How's the view at 8,000 meters, tourist?
802050001 ...Let me fill you in on the plan.
802050002 While you were captured, Arquebus finished work on the Vascular Plant.
802050003 It's pulling the Coral through Rubicon's atmosphere, it won't be long till they take it all.
802050004 We need to burn the Coral before it's too late.
802050005 Of course, we can't just walk up the Plant and light a match.
802050006 No, we're going to need something bigger. lot bigger.
802050007 Well? Figured it out?
802050008 The Xylem isn't just our means reaching the Plant.
802050009 It's a giant powder keg.
802050010 Plenty to set all that Coral off.
802050011 ...
802050012 Is that...the Observers' plan...?
802060000 ...
802060001 The corporations want only to devour the Coral.
802060002 The Observers fear the Coral, want only to eradicate it.
802060003 ...
802060004 I... I believe in the shared potential humanity and the Coral.
802060005 Raven.
802060006 I need to ask you something.

802070010 Allow us to explain.
802070011 You are in the vicinity of a closure satellite... the Xylem's hold.
802070012 As anticipated, the corporations have siphoned Coral into a single mass.
802070013 All that remains is to seize the opportunity set the Coral free...
802070014 so that it may carry humanity new horizons.
802070015 The Coral Release is imminent.

911270011 That request to escort the STRIDER out to be something else entirely.
911270012 ...I hear that those strange machines't come from the corps.

911270014 Be careful out there, Raven.'s more to this.

913000011 During Operation Wallclimber...
913000012 Arquebus was planning to sacrifice you.
913000013 The plan was to use independent mercenaries to clear way so that the Vespers could step in and take over.
913000014 But instead...you took the Wall.
913000015 The higher-ups are going to remember now, that's for sure.

914000016 ...How's things on your end?

914020012 Their jobs. did what it took to get us here.
914020013 ...Huh. how's the newcomer doing?
914020014 Relatively stable, it seems.
914020015 But we've run into someone shady.
914020016 Someone you want me to look into.
914020017 Yeah. Independent mercenary. Goes by "Kate."
914100010 ...Got a job for you, 621.

920200011 This could just be another one of her traps...
920200012 But after the impression you left on her last time, think it's unlikely.
920200013 Let's take a look at the briefing.
920220010 Hey tourist! It's me, Carla.
920220011 Had to work some of my magic to track you down.
920220012 I've got a little job for you. a look.
920220020 ...Raven. It's highly unusual to receive from hostile sources.
920220021 Did she hack into ALLMIND's mercenary database...?

921000011 I see you're heading for the cargo launcher now. a bad idea, I'll give you that.

921020010 Guess you noticed that job from Balam... decided to take it.
921020011 Next time, look before you leap. can't trust anyone on Rubicon.
921020012 ...

921021010 ...Raven. I've managed to decode encrypted comms.
921021011 They identified you as an
921021012 ... what is the Release Project?
930000010 Looks like you've made it the Central Ice Field, 621.
930000011 Good. I'm done tying up loose ends.
930000012 Arquebus found their own way in are ready to deploy survey squads.
930000013 And it looks like Balam's come running you scoped out the place, too.
930000014 You know what's going to happen: as usual.

930002010 Raven.
930002011 I was looking into the Arena, and I discovered you might want to know about.
930002012 It's a network service that was labeled "Nest," no obvious clues about its purpose.
930002013 From what I can tell, it's a special mercenary program—encrypted and kept secret.
930002014 I've installed a backdoor, so you'll have trouble getting in as you please.
930020010 Raven.
930020011 I've been looking into the Integration Program, I turned up something interesting.
930020012 It looks like ALLMIND's been gathering data new craft no one even knows about yet.
930020013 ...I've installed a backdoor. about taking a peek, Raven?
931000010 I see you got a call from V.IV.
931000011 I've been contacted as well—by the Balam group.
931000012 Seems both sides have been to halt the Coral survey.
931000013 Check the briefings, 621.
931001010 ...Raven.
931001011 I've picked up a good job for you, too.
931001012 I know you've established yourself as of the corporations' preferred mercenaries...
931001013 but I was hoping you might learn more the people who live on Rubicon.
931010010 Raven.
931010011 I've...also picked up a job for you.

931100014 That is all.
931100015 We at the Arquebus Group expect much from you.
931200010 Attention, G13 Raven!
931200011 I have a message for you from Commander Michigan, your success at the Engebret Tunnel.

931200013 "That's one way to light a fire under your ass— it alive for the next field trip."
931200014 Over and out!
931210010 Raven. I've been thinking about Middle Flatwell said.
931210011 "To fly beyond Rubicon's scorched skies chase the freedom we never knew..."
931210012 The others are so used to fighting and slogans that they've given up thinking.
931210013 But Flatwell...'s exploring the potential for something new.
931300010 Raven. You have our gratitude eliminating Swinburne.
931300011 Some of us were worried that the enemy have won you over.
931300012 But it seems we can trust you after all. to be on the same side.

931301012 The company has allocated you an appropriate, as I'm sure you've noticed.

931301014 He has now been sent for re-education the orders of V.II Snail.
931301015 That is all. Arquebus Group expects much from you.
932000010 How's it going, Walter?
932000011 Hard to say.
932000012 621's still performing well, I doubt the voices have gone away.
932000013 At any rate, whatever the voices are't seem to be doing any harm...for now.
932000014 ...I was asking about you, Walter, but whatever.
932000015 Bigger things. The Coral. You'd better find it.
932000016 Turns out, our friends' fears were warranted.

932100012 and stranger still, the PCA personally to block the survey.
932100013 There must be more to Xylem...
932100014 and to Walter's "friend."
932150010 ...Raven.
932150011 There's something you need to know Thumb Dolmayan.
932150012 I managed to retrieve some data the wreckage of his AC...
932150013 It's something about...Coral Release.
932150020 ...It seems Dolmayan really did Contact, like you and I.
932150021 Release... To free the Coral, "go to the other side..."
932150022 The potential for symbiosis....
932151010 ...
932151011 ...There was something else, Raven.
932151012 The Integration Program has been updated some unknown AC data.
932151013 We should take a look.

932180010 Raven. you for taking the CATAPHRACT mission.
932180011 Uncle Flatwell was pleased. called you a "valuable asset."
932180012 With your help, maybe we can beat corporations—and the PCA.
932180013 ...Nah. We need to stand on our own two feet—'s how we'll win.
932200010 "Chatty" Stick, RaD. for helping with the firework show.
932200011 The chief loved working with you... don't be a stranger.
932200012 That's all I had to say. Later.
933000010 You again? I'm a busy man. too busy for the likes of you.
933000011 ...So I hear. Must be a tough time be the Vespers' deputy commander.
933000012 Get to the point.
933000013 The plan to raid the PCA.'re going to need more pawns on the board.
933000014 ...Of course.'re here to hawk your services again.
933000015 Very well. I'll consider that mutt yours part of the effort.
933000016 One more thing... my hound some respect.
933000017 Gen Four's as good a pedigree as any other.
933020010 Raven, just so you know...
933020011 It looks like some unknown craft data been added to the Integration Program.
933020012 Why don't we go take a peek?
934000010 Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven. records have been updated.
934000011 B-Rank virtual encounters are available in the Arena.
934000012 You have entered the upper ranks.

934001010 Heard the news, tourist.
934001011 Ice Worm, huh. You just keep tripping up over Institute's relics, don't ya?
934001012 Well, I got something that might interest you. you a briefing.
934002010 This is V.VIII Pater. Your performance in spaceport raid was admirable.
934002011 V.II and V.IV left a message for you...but the arrival that monster is a more pressing matter.
934002012 Arquebus and Balam have agreed to a ceasefire are looking to cooperate—for the moment.
934002013 It'll take time to formalize our agreement. now, I've sent you another request.
934010010 Sorry to impose on you, Raven, I've just sent you an urgent request.
934010011 I wish we could deal with this on our own... we've got no choice but to count on you.
934010012 Take a look and see what you think.
934020010 Raven.
934020011 We've received a request... it's about Coral Release.
934020012 The message is highly encrypted with top-level security, designed not to leave a trace.
934020013 In other words...ALLMIND doesn't want to know about this.
934020014 ...
934020015 Let's take a look and decide what to do.
934100010 This is "Chatty" Stick, RaD.
934100011 Thanks for putting down Brute.
934100012 The chief's already in the workshop the Rail Cannon...
934100013 and I've never seen her happier to be at work.
934100014 That is all. Later, tourist.
934250010 I've looked into the other "Raven"... independent mercenary who attacked you.
934250011 It turns out that "Raven"'t an individual callsign...
934250012 It's a title—passed down generations of mercenaries champion the free will "Raven" stands for.
934250013 ...
934250014 They choose what to fight for, take to the skies in flight.
934250015 If that's what being a Raven means...
934250016 then that's the name I want to keep calling you.
934250017 Raven.
934260010 I've looked into "Branch"... independent mercenaries who attacked you.
934260011 It appears they don't have a fixed membership...
934260012 Instead, they maintain independence and anonymity a revolving door of select mercenaries.
934260013 ...
934260014 Now, it seems, they've left it to you champion the free will they stood for.
934260015 Sooner or later...you'll have to make a choice one can make for you.
934260016 When that time comes, hope I can support you...
934260017 Raven.
934350010 ...What kept you, 621?
934350011 You're a famous mercenary now. to act like one.
934350012 ...
934350013 Just get some rest.'s the important thing.
934351010 ...What kept you, 621?
934351011 You're a famous mercenary now. to act like one.
934351012 ...
934351013 This next mission's all or nothing.
934351014 Make sure you attend the briefing.
934370010 Raven, there's something that me about ALLMIND.
934370011 I've been looking for information on Markson, and...there's nothing.
934370012 Is she another "asset" to the Release Project?
935000010 We got ourselves a deal, Handler Walter!
935000011 Michigan. So Arquebus met us halfway?
935000012 I gave them the heavy warship fleet. In exchange,'s in charge of putting down the beast.
935000013 They also offered some top Vespers... they don't trust us.
935000014 Better than nothing.'ll provide what support I can, too.
935000015 Yeah, your mad scientists...RaD or whatever. that hound of yours...
935000016 ...Michigan.
935000017 Don't underestimate 621. hound always delivers.
935100010 ...Time for work, 621.
935100011 This next mission's all or nothing.
935100012 Make sure you attend the briefing.
940000010 Doing okay, 621?
940000011 I'd wanted to let you rest some more, the corps are on the move already.
940000012 With the PCA gone, it's back to work: to where the Coral's gathering.
940000013 Do you remember the survey carried out at Xylem?
940000014 My friend analyzed the data—and learned about massive facility under the Central Ice Field.
940000015 Watchpoint Alpha.
940000016 Turns out that the Ice Worm was defending entrance to that place...
940000017 It's time to let ourselves in.
940001010 ...
940001011 Raven, there's something you need to know.
940001012 That "friend" Walter mentioned...
940001013 The comms database has no record of conversation he just told you about.
940001014 This isn't about just finding the Coral, Raven.
940001015 He's after something more, he's using you to do it...
940001016 Here on Rubicon.
940002010 Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven. records have been updated.
940002011 A-Rank virtual encounters are available in the Arena.
940002012 May these encounters further your technique.

940010012 You may now test updates to MIND BETA verify reproductions of special ACs.
940010013 We look forward to your continued assistance ALLMIND's drive toward perfection.
940020010 ...Raven.
940020011 We're getting close to the Coral convergence.
940020012 I expect...ALLMIND will be getting involved soon.
940021010 Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven. records have been updated.
940021011 ...
940021012 Sorry, Raven. It's just me.
940021013 I wanted to let you know that some strange new data been added to the Arena's Integration Program.
940021014 Why don't we go and have a look?
943000010 How was the trip underground, Walter?
943000011 The Enforcement System's silent, at least.
943000012 Tried to take 621 with it... thing it failed.
943000013 Well, that deals with the PCA, then.
943000014 ...What about the corps?
943000015 Arquebus told us to wait entering terra incognita.
943000016 So you're close, then. The corps won't be each other over the finish line.
943000017 Yeah. Arquebus wants Balam out the picture first.
943000018 Looks like Arquebus is gonna win race no matter what.
943000019 Short term, maybe. I think 621's going to be the key in the end.
943000020 And that's why I shouldn't be the one choose which jobs we take.
943000021 Sounds risky. Our friends must be getting antsy.
943000022 Maybe. But I think 621's got friends worry about too.
943001010 Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven. records have been updated.

943010012 It was sent by Middle Flatwell...
943010013 He's the de facto leader of the Liberation Front... he wants to meet you.
943020010 Raven.
943020011 You've got two requests go with the order from Arquebus.
943020012 One is from the Liberation Front...
943020013 The other's from ALLMIND.
943020014 ...
943020015 You should consider your choice means, Raven.
943020016 For my part...I've chosen to trust in you.
943020017 Whatever you decide... know you'll mean it.
943150010 Didn't think I'd see the end of the Redguns...
943150011 ...You did your job, 621. knew the score.
943150012 Balam's withdrawn from Rubicon. politicians will be fighting their war now...
943150013 Where there's Coral, there's blood.
943150014 That's how it's always been, 621.
943150070 ...
943150071 Raven.
943150072 Are we...doomed to spark conflict we go?
943160010 About the request to attack the Redguns... like V.IV Rusty took care of it.
943160011 ...Michigan's dead. he went down fighting.
943160012 Balam's withdrawn from Rubicon. politicians will be fighting their war now...
943160013 Where there's Coral, there's blood.
943160014 That's how it's always been, 621.
943160070 ...
943160071 Raven.
943160072 Are we...doomed to spark conflict we go?

943170012 We will meet again— you reach the Coral convergence.
945000010 Raven.
945000011 I see them so clearly...
945000012 The voices of the Coral... My family.
945000013 ...
945000014 Brothers and sisters, by the Fires of Ibis.
945000015 Only a few survived, but after all this time,'ve finally formed a new flock...
945000016 ...
945000017 It looks like Walter has sent you a message.
945000018 Let's take a look, Raven.
945001010 Let me tell you a story before you go.
945001011 There once was a scientist. He abandoned his family delve into the secrets of Coral.
945001012 His work yielded a carnival of horrors. surgery included.
945001013 But there was another scientist.
945001014 He took his colleague's sins upon himself set it all ablaze... Died with no regrets.
945001015 ...There's a lesson in this story.
945001016 Once something's alive, it doesn't die easy.
945001017 621.
945001018 Story time's over. It's time for work.
950100010 Back in your old AC? were made for each other.
950100011 ...
950100012 The fact that you're still alive that Walter made the right bet.
950100013 Alright. You deserve to know we've been fighting for.
950100014 I'll get you introduced with the next mission.
960100010 Just went to say goodbye to Chatty.
960100011 He was an AI I developed.'ve moved him into a new body, but...
960100012 Well, I never could bring myself to back him up.
960100013 It'd be like taking the life out of him.
960100014 ...
960100015 ...You seem like you've lost someone too.
960100016 Hope I'm just imagining things.
970100010 ...Carla had planned everything, her own death.
970100011 Just like Walter... both wanted someone to inherit their legacy...
970100012 ...
970100013 The Rubiconians are continuing to resist corporations on the ground, even now.
970100014 The potential of humanity and Coral't the only thing we have to protect.
970100015 Raven.
970100016 There has to be something we can do.
980000010 We've received a message from ALLMIND.
980000011 It sounds like they want to bring you under their as part of the Coral Release project.
980000012 Let's hear them out.

981100011 ...

981100013 Now that the choice is made, we have to carry on.
981100014 No matter what obstacles confront us.
982100010 Raven.
982100011 You see it too, don't you?
982100012 The Coral voices...waiting to be released the Vascular Plant.

991300013 The day will come when's evolution truly takes form.
991400010 What do you think ALLMIND collecting all this data for?
991400011 I'm concerned about what these notes mean...
991400012 What is the "primary factor?"
991500010 That machine... It clearly used Coral technology.
991500011 But what connection does it have the Fires of Ibis?
991600010 That was incredible, Raven.
991600011 There's something I realized I was playing the role of pilot.
991600012 Humanity assumed its current form fight itself.
991600013 To choose from infinite selections.
991600014 That is the essence of the human race...
991600015 and the key to biological evolution.
991600016 ...
991600017 Perhaps it is also a clue to ALLMIND's true goal is.
