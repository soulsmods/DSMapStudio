        "ESDLang is a high-level language for viewing and editing ESD scripts, primarily to understand NPC quests and interactions, make significant quest edits, and add convenience features to bonfires. It decompiles ESD files into a subset of Python. These Python files cannot be executed as Python. They can only be recompiled.",
        "DS1, DS2, Bloodborne, DS3, Sekiro, and Elden Ring are supported. See game dumps in the examples/ directory."
