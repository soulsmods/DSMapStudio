        "DSLuaDecompiler is an advanced Lua decompiler focused on decompiling Lua scripts found in various FromSoft games for modding purposes. A heavy emphasis is placed on decompilation accuracy, with the eventual goal being to get a matching decompilation for every script found in every modern FromSoft game released (which includes Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, Elden Ring, and Armored Core 6).",
        "The decompiler primarily targets Lua 5.0, which is used for AI scripts in almost all FromSoft games, and HavokScript, which is used for character control logic in Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, and Elden Ring.",
        "Support for other Lua versions are generally out of scope for now with the exception of early support for Lua 5.3, which is used to implement UI logic in Super Smash Bros Ultimate."
