        "Armored Core VI makes use of a layered map system, where each mission-specific map overlays a base map, which contains all of the shared level map objects.",
        "For example, the mission Illegal Entry is represented by the m01_01_00_00 MSB file. If you open this individually, all you will see are the mission-specific map objects, which tend to be enemies, events and regions.",
        "To see the actual level, you will need to load the m10_00_00_00 MSB file too. This is the base map, and contains the assets that comprise much of each mission's level geometry.",
        ""
