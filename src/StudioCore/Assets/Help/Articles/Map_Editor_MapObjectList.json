        "The Map Object List window is one of the most important windows when editing a map.",
        "By default, it will display a list of all the available map files (known as MSB files). To load a map, you can double-click the name, or right-click and select 'Load Map'.",
        "[Header]Map Groups",
        "The Map Group filter, represented by the Map Group Category and Map Group combo-boxes. This allows you to filter the list by pre-defined map groups. For example, within an Elden Ring project, if you change Map Group Category to 'Altus Plateau', the options within the Map Group combo-box will be restricted to those within the Altus Plateau.",
        "You can then select an option from the Map Group combo-box, such as 'Altus Plateau - Shaded Castle'. This will filter the map list down to the map files associated with the Shaded Castle specifically, which in this case is the four individual tiles that represent the Shaded Castle, the area base map, and the region base map.",
        "[Header]Map ID Search",
        "The Map ID Search filter allows you to directly filter via a word. For example, if you type m10, only map files that begin with m10 will appear in the map list.",
        "[Header]Map Data",
        "Once you have loaded a map, the map list will display a tree map below the map file name. You can then click on the individual sections to open them up, exposing the individual entries for each type of map object.",
