        "Regex is a common way to write an expression that 'matches' strings",
        "or words, finding occurances within a passage of text.",
        "",
        "For letters and numbers, regex matches only those explicit characters",
        "and nothing else.",
        "",
        "This means searching for dog, you will only match when 'dog' is found.",
        "Regex also has many meta-characters, and most symbols have some meaning.",
        "For example, * means 'any number of the previous character'.",
        "In this case, Do*g matches Dg, Dog, Doog, Dooog... etc.",
        "",
        "Regex can also provide options with the | symbol (OR symbol).",
        "Dog|Frog matches Dog or Frog.",
        "",
        "This isn't always useful as maybe only part of your expression is optional.",
        "You can use brackets to seperate that part.",
        "In this manner, (D|Fr)og matches Dog or Frog.",
        "You can even use * on a bracketed expression.",
        "",
        "Sometimes it doesn't make sense to write (0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9),",
        "so regex also has something called ranges.",
        "",
        "This is written as [abc123*+] and matches any single character inside.",
        "Many metacharacters also don't function inside, and merely match themselves",
        "literally.",
        "",
        "They can also include expressions like [1-9] and [a-zA-Z]",
        "which include the middle numbers and letters.",
        "",
        "As if that wasn't enough, for common ones of these there are more",
        "shorthands called character classes.",
        "\\d matches [0-9], ",
        "\\w matches any letter, number, or _,",
        "\\s matches any whitespace",
        ". matches any character at all - which makes .* a handy 'match any amount of anything'.",
        "",
        "Character classes can also begin with ^ to mean any character NOT given.",
        "So [^0] is any nonzero character.",
        "",
        "Finally, regex is often used to find occurances within text, not to match the entire text.",
        "The character ^ is used to match the start of the text, and $ the end.",
        "A statement like ^[^-] will only match text that begins with something other",
        "than - for example.",
        "",
        "Regex has a broad syntax and application, but with this quick guide and an online cheatsheet,",
        "many interesting combinations are possible.",
        "While regex is aimed at text and is not perfect for numbers, it can still be useful.",
        "",
        "Some common tools for mapstudio include:",
        "   .* (match anything)",
        "   ^10$ (match only when the entire input is 10)",
        "   [^0] (match anything that isn't just 0)",
        "   ^[^-] (match anything that doesn't begin with -)",
        "   ^2\\d\\d$ (match any number from 200 to 299)"
