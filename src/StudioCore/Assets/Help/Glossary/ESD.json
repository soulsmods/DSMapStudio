        "A state machine-based scripting format used from Dark Souls I onwards.",
        "It is used in all games for dialogue scripting, including for bonfires and similar interactable objects.",
        "",
        "In Dark Souls I it is used for chaining character actions performed in the game, a role subsumed by Havok behavior files in subsequent games.",
        "",
        "In Dark Souls II it is used for event scripting, instead of EMEVD, and some AI scripting.",
        "These state machines are pulled into the game from map data, usually MSB, and associated with specific map entities while they are running.",
        "",
        "In Dark Souls II and onwards, state machines can call into other state machines in the same ESD file like subroutines."
