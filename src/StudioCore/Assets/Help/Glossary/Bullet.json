        "A bullet is an in-game projectile that can apply some damage and/or effect if it hits.",
        "In most cases bullets are used for typical projectile purposes however there are esoteric cases such as the Perilous Symbol in Sekiro.",
        "Typically a bullet is invoked via TAE through the usage of a behavior, but they can also be invoked through SpEffects and via EMEVD."
