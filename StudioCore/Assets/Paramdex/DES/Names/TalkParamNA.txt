29100 on this gate
29101 open it quickly
29110 Hurry up
29120 thank you somehow
11100 Hey, hey, help me, I'm surrounded by slave soldiers and I can't move from here
11110 thank you, that was helpful
11111 I am Ostrava of Galantaria. This is my gratitude, please accept it
11120 Now, excuse me. ...I have a mission to do
11130 …I never thought I would jump from there…
11131 No, it was better. get rid of the slave soldiers
11140 Everywhere you go, people are hungry for Seoul
11141 Are there no decent people in Galantaria anymore?
11200 Hey, it's here, it's here, it's Ostrava
11201 Unknowingly, I was driven into the corner by the soldiers. Excuse me, can you help me again?
11202 Can you get rid of the soldiers at the end of this passage?
11203 Ah, the King's Road ahead is now a feeding ground for flying dragons. be careful
11210 thank you, this is the second time
11211 Thanks to you, we can move forward. This is my gratitude, please accept it
11221 No, no one...why...
11222 Why is this... Father...
11300 Hey, hey!
11301 We are being chased by hungry soldiers! Hurry up and open this place!
11302 Please, hurry up! They're almost there!
11310 thank you! Was saved!
11320 dead end?
11321 No, no, help me!
11322 I can't, I'll kill you!
11330 Was saved…
11331 This is the third time, I really appreciate you...
11332 This...there's nothing more...
11333 Well then, I'm going... the royal palace is just around the corner...
11340 The royal palace is almost here...
11400 oh is it you
11401 … Above this is my father
11402 No, father, is it a demon from another world in the form of Lendl?
11403 I continued my reckless journey to question and admonish my father, but it seems that it was a farce of self-righteousness...
11404 I beg you. kill my father That is nothing more than an enemy to the human world...
11405 this…. It's the key to the Galantaria Mausoleum.
11406 The mausoleum enshrines Demonbrand, the counterpart to his father's sword, Soulbrand.
11407 So my father...
11410 what are you doing
11411 stop it! I thought you were my friend!
11415 what are you doing
11420 Hey, wait a minute!
11421 Where are you going all of a sudden!
11430 What's wrong, it suddenly...
11431 I guess it's convenient for you...
11500 Boletaria has a legend of two swords and a hero
11501 The two swords are Demon Brand and Soul Brand
11502 Two swords that cut off the existence of humans and cut off the existence of humans.
11503 One hero is the old king Doran
11504 The hero of the founding of Boletaria, and the ``one who lives forever'' who protects the two swords.
11505 …haha. Well, it's just an old lore
11506 Under these circumstances, does it make you want to believe in tradition?
11510 Boletaria was a wonderful country
11511 Kings, knights, and people were simple, poor but mighty, and had a dry warmth.
11512 I have studied in many advanced countries in the south, but I have not yet known a country more attractive than Boletaria.
11513 But why is this...
11514 I just can't believe my father would have wanted this...
11520 Orlando, king of Boletaria, was accompanied by many fine knights.
11521 Twin Swords Bjor and Valalfax
11522 Knight Alfred of the Tower and Knight Methus of the Piercing
11523 Alien Hero, Uhlan the Longbow and His Barbarians
11524 but now it's a disaster
11525 Varalfax died with lore, Bjorngrim went missing years ago in a rift
11526 The others, along with Boletaria, must have been swallowed up by the mist, and the demons had overrun them along with the people.
11527 Boletarian Knights are a thing of the past
11528 Maybe it's time for a new hero like you to be born...
11530 what are you doing
11531 stop it! I thought you were my friend!
11540 Hey, wait a minute!
11541 Where are you going all of a sudden!
11550 What's wrong, it suddenly...
11551 I guess it's convenient for you...
12000 heh, what happened If you need anything, I'll consult with you.
12001 Of course, it's all stolen goods, but... I'd like to ask you to ignore that.
12010 There is Maido. please again
12020 Well, there are times when I feel miserable.
12021 Thank you again, hehehe
12030 Hey, nice to meet you again. It seems that there is a connection
12031 Thank you very much
12040 hey what do you need
12050 Maido
12060 The great knight and my fellow slaves have all gone crazy after their souls have been stolen by demons.
12061 And so, those guys attacked every decent human being...
12062 Well, the Great Boletaria is over.
12063 Of course, it's not like I'm forced to fight unreasonably, so I guess it's all about demons, hehehehehe
12070 Oh yeah, I've seen decent people besides you
12071 Despite being thin, he wore heavy armor and asked what his mission was.
12072 I'm sure he's some kind of aristocratic boy, isn't he?
12073 Don't you think you've got some really cool stuff, huh...
12080 King? Have you lost your mind?
12081 Well, a low-ranking person like me can't understand what a high-ranking person thinks.
12090 Are you that big lizard?
12091 The king brought me here with the demons
12092 Because he burns everyone to death, he can steal as much as he wants, and his business is prosperous.
12093 Please take care of yourself too, hehehe
12100 What are you!
12102 Try more than that, I'll kill you!
12110 Well, it can't be helped if you're cold and poor
12111 This time please, hehehe
12120 Hey you! Didn't you have something to do?
12130 …If you need anything, just say so.
13000 (G, M…) Who is it?
13001 Have I been released...?
13002 ...!
13003 Hummoooooo... yes! Forgive me for that gnat!
13010 A gnat that flatters His Majesty!
13011 Hungry and still no vulgar sex!
13020 yeah? what about you? … oh the man who saved me
13021 My name is Bjornheim. One of the twin swords of Galantaria. thank you sir
13022 That said, it's nothing. because i don't have anything
13023 Now I go to sleep go ahead
13030 Guooooooooo...
13040 Sir, I will help you
13041 Cheeky imitation of a knight...
13042 A muddy demon! I'm sorry!
13045 It's over, Damon!
13046 Gahahahahahahaha
13050 Sir, I'll help you
13051 Leave the jumping lizard to me
13052 May Galantaria and His Majesty shine!
13060 Bow letterer!
13061 Gahahahahahahahaha
13070 Sir, where are you going?
13071 He's such an impatient man (Gahahahahahaha)
13080 Wow!
13081 Sir, what are you doing! Are you out of your mind!
13082 No matter how old you are, don't underestimate Orlant's twin swords!
13085 Wow!
13500 Your Majesty was a great king
13501 Strong, full of ambition, he loved the lowly people, and hated vice and meanness.
13502 It's just a Confucianist's nonsense to say that His Majesty caused this disaster... that he's crazy.
13503 It should be too much...
13510 My friend, Valalfax the Twinblade, was a fine knight.
13511 Unlike me, he was a genius who excelled not only in swordsmanship but also in wisdom and bravery.
13512 Even if he was by his Majesty's side, Boletaria would perish.
13513 If that's the case, it means that no one could stop it...
13520 Who?
13521 …I see, you killed that gnat and saved me.
13522 My name is Bjorn Grimm. One of the twin swords of Galantaria. thank you for your courage
13523 That said, it won't do anything. because i don't have anything
13524 Go ahead. i sleep a little...
13530 sir you gotta do it
13531 Well, after all, it's an imitation of a demon, and it's not even close to being a true warrior.
13532 Go ahead, sir. I'm a little tired because of my age. sleep a little...
13540 Phew, how did it go? The jumping lizard makes me bother
13541 Go ahead, sir. I think you already know, but I'm going to sleep a little...
13542 The jumping lizard... it's amazing...
13550 I heard a strange story from a slave soldier selling goods...
13551 Her Majesty's child, Ariona-sama, entered Boletaria alone.
13552 Ariona-sama is a wise person, but she's too kind in all things.
13553 If you also see Ariona-sama, please help her and advise her to return to this temple.
13554 Bjor of twin swords will help the prince, even if it's not enough.
13560 …You intend to challenge His Majesty, right?
13561 You don't have to be stupid. If it's something that kills demons, it's perfectly natural.
13562 But now at his Majesty's side are the black souls of the great knights and the fire-breathing jumping lizards.
13563 I too was defeated by them and imprisoned in the dungeon.
13564 You should also be very careful...
13570 In the moat surrounding Boletaria's main castle, there's a lone stone tower, right?
13571 The gnats boasted that they had captured the witch's daughter in that tower and were repeating their shameful deeds.
13572 It's really disgusting, but no matter what, I can't get into that tower...
13573 The gnats are spoiling His Majesty's prestige as they please...
13580 oh sir
13581 You rescued the witch's daughter from that tower!
13582 appreciate. No matter what the reason is, there is no way that such a good girl should be oppressed.
13583 Your Majesty, without a doubt, should say so...
13590 Sir, where are you going?
13591 He's such an impatient man (Gahahahahahaha)
13600 Wow!
13601 Sir, what are you doing! Are you out of your mind!
13602 No matter how old you are, don't underestimate the twin swords of Orlant!
13605 Wow!
14000 …Who?
14001 … another change …
14002 well, at least do what you like
14003 There's nothing to gain but this skinny body
14005 …Who?
14010 …you?
14011 …He opened me up…Is it…Is that so…
14012 thank you. I'm fine
14013 If you rest a little, you should be able to walk
14016 you first. It's a hindrance to me now
14500 Oh you who saved me
14501 ...I'm sorry. I have no way of showing respect
14502 However, with Demon's Souls, I can provide you with magic.
14503 A witch's magic is nothing but an abomination and a fallen art
14504 Freki-sama's magic would be more suitable for you...
14506 it doesn't suit you...
14510 No way, do you want the magic of a witch?
14511 I'm happy to be your strength, but...
14512 is it really good?
14520 I need more magic
14521 I know it. I'll do anything I can
14530 i am grateful to you
14531 If you want witchcraft, just tell me anytime
14532 Dirty karma, that's all I have...
14540 Do you mind if I talk strangely?
14541 Ever since I was little, I've been called a witch, and I've been despised and despised by people...
14542 But it's the right way
14543 Something divine sent down souls not for magic, but for human thought
14544 Magic is taboo. This is not about saving people
14545 …I think so after entering Boletaria
14546 I'm afraid of Freke-sama... He's a prisoner of magic...
14550 Once upon a time, I also wanted Demon's Souls
14551 Enter Boletaria through the chasm and be bound to this temple
14552 And then, he was captured in that tower by Miralda, the king's convict.
14553 But... now I'm no longer attracted to the power of Demon's Souls
14554 Rather, I want that power to be lost...
14560 Do you know the Yurt, Lord of Silence?
14561 A man in black armor with two twisted horns.
14562 After Yurt appeared in Boletaria, I heard that many heroes fell into his hands.
14563 I don't know the purpose. I don't know, but there is no doubt that they are enemies
14564 Take good care of yourself, too. Because demons and starving men aren't the only enemies
14570 A witch's sorcery is different from the sorcery of Lord Freke.
14571 Flake-sama understands the Demon's Souls and uses them as his own power.
14572 A witch's magic simply obeys the Demon's Soul and manifests its power.
14573 If demons are cursed, witches' magic is also cursed
14574 That's not what Freki-sama said, it's not the work of a human...
14580 thank you. May my art help you
14590 thank you. Tell me again if you need me
14600 a…
14610 where are you going
14620 What!
14630 a…
14640 where are you going
14650 What!
14651 Are you the same? ?
15000 heh heh heh heh...
15001 It took, a thug who defies the will of the king
15002 Take Miralda's judgment
15010 dead, of course
15011 Hee hee hee hee...
15020 A fool who defies the will of the king...
15021 Hee hee hee hee... hee...
15030 Hee hee hee hee
16000 oh you're human...
16001 My body hurts, it hurts, it smells so bad...
16002 I'm begging you, please take it easy...
16003 Please...
16010 thank you
16011 sorry dad...
17000 Phew, you saved me
17001 No way, it's crazy that I'm caught in such a trap
17002 oh dear thank you
17003 I'm Blige the Excavator
17004 It's a thank you, but I don't mind if you provide me with the necessities.
17005 It's a place like this, why are you in trouble anyway?
17010 Are you satisfied? I will continue to purchase various things from now on
17011 Let's get along well together, brother
17020 don't you need it? Well, I don't mind being thin
17021 I'm sure you'll change your mind soon...
17030 What are you? i met you again
17031 Why are you in need? You look terrible, hahaha
17040 Oh you I'll be flexible again, what do you want?
17050 Is it enough? see you soon
17051 don't die, brother
17060 This place used to be a barbarian shrine that worshiped a dubious curse.
17061 Of course, the barbarians have long since perished, and only the souls of the dead are used by demons.
17062 Skeletons and shadows are all the same. All of them should live from the beginning
17063 that's why i'm here
17064 ...Even though I'm hungry for Soul, it doesn't feel good to kill a former human...
17070 You, in anticipation of your brother, I'll give you one piece of advice
17071 Watch out for the hyena patches
17072 That guy can only stab people in the back, he's a real piece of junk
17073 It's not even worth keeping alive, if you see it, it's better for you to kill it.
17080 Do you know the Altar of the Shadow Sorcerer?
17081 From that altar cellar, I heard the voices of prayer all the time
17082 It must have been stuck in the patch, but it's fine, it smells fishy
17090 Barbarians sacrificed their brave dead to the storm at this shrine
17091 This was the last place the storm seekers and the storm bearers could see.
17092 That said, all that was stored was junk...
17093 Seriously, I spotted something out of the ordinary... Excavator Blige's name makes me cry...
17100 What are you doing, you!
17101 Have you been hit by Seoul? ?
17110 Heh... well, I wouldn't say it's unreasonable
17111 I'm sure you'll change your mind soon...
17120 hey you It's not like you're talking to me!
17130 …Well, I will forgive you this time. be careful from now on
17140 ...there's nothing to accommodate you...
18000 yeah? You don't know
18001 Well, it's the same for everyone. If it's a blacksmithing request, shut up and go there. If not, shut up and leave
18010 Hmm. what do you want
18011 If it's a blacksmithing request, shut up and go there. If not, shut up and leave
18020 Are you done? Then get out, you're in the way of work
18030 Hmm. what the hell
18034 Hey, where are you going!
18036 …I have no use for someone like you
18037 I'm busy. shut up and get out
18040 I'm busy. I'm not going to make small talk
18041 …Weapons become stronger by burning ore, and change their characteristics.
18042 The ore is the split body of the spirit. They celebrate weapons
18050 How many times do I have to tell you? I'm busy, I'm not going to make small talk
18051 … ores are finicky and selfish
18052 No matter how much you try to soothe them, different species will never bless the same weapon.
18053 Of course, there seem to be exceptions when it comes to fickle people...
18060 Say you're busy
18061 …Even ores have ranks, right?
18062 Strong weapons are only blessed by high-ranking ores
18063 The purest ore of the highest order is the spirit itself, with its moist and noble luster... Uhuhuhuhuhu...
18070 …Demon Soul?
18071 …Sure, that thing is like a strong spirit. Some of them can bless weapons
18072 Of course, you need a strong flame for that.
18073 Like a fiery demon's soul, it...
18080 Oh, then, that red-hot demon's soul
18081 With it, you could make the demon's soul bless your weapon.
18090 Hmm, okay. If you refuse here, you'll lose the name of Blacksmith Ed.
18091 Bring me some demon souls. Let the eagle bless your weapon
18100 …What is it?
18101 So from the beginning, I should have given you a boring expectation that you shouldn't talk like that.
18102 A snob who doesn't understand the value of blacksmithing is a waste of a demon's soul...
18110 What are you doing!
18111 I'm just a blacksmith!
19000 you, you
19001 Buy me something This kid is hungry
19010 Are you done yet?
19011 This kid has a big appetite, you know
19020 I'm not kidding, it's cool
19021 Don't become an offering to that woman!
19030 What are you?
19031 Buy me something This kid is sick, I thought I'd help
19040 Are you done yet?
19041 You see, the poor man's child is dying, you
19050 Please buy me something again. for this child
19060 Are you done yet?
19061 …I wonder if this child can still be happy
19070 Everything's been bad since that demon girl came, yeah
19071 This place used to be better before that woman came. Even I was the object of admiration for boys
19072 Are you going to get rid of that woman? Please don't show mercy
19080 Expecting you, I'll tell you one thing I'm good at
19081 Hey, this place is a nest of various poisonous insects that are fattened up in Seoul.
19082 If you don't want to die, lotus is a must
19083 If you think of it as the price of life, it's not expensive at all
19090 here? This place is just a dumpster
19091 Even people, all rotten things are washed away here
19092 Thanks to that, this kid has nothing to lose...
19100 I wonder how many years ago...
19101 A woman named Astraea came to this valley with a squid-like knight.
19102 In a place like this, wearing such white and beautiful clothes, you looked at me and this child with disdainful eyes.
19103 Yeah, she's been a disgusting girl from the beginning
19104 It was no surprise to me that she was a demon
19110 What are you doing!
19111 Don't underestimate me because I'm a maiden!
19120 Hey you! Where are you going!
19130 What the fuck, you
19131 Everyone looks like an idiot...
20000 … oh, a human
20001 I'm flake. As you can see, I've been imprisoned in this prison for a long time.
20002 sir, will you set me free
20003 If so, I will give you the power of a sage
20004 Watch out for the octopus-headed guards
20010 Oh, I never thought I'd be able to escape this prison alive
20011 My name is Flake. Also called sage
20012 I asked for a demon's soul for magic, but it's like this
20013 Due to the long life in captivity, my body has weakened badly.
20014 If this leg starts moving, I should be able to escape to the temple of the wedge.
20015 This is at least a thank you
20020 Due to the long life in captivity, my body has deteriorated badly.
20021 If my legs start moving, I should be able to escape to the temple of the wedge.
20500 HM…
20501 I have a proposal for you
20502 Can you provide me with the demon soul that you obtained?
20503 I will touch it, get closer to the truth of Seoul, and give you new magic.
20504 A demon's soul isn't just a mass of souls
20505 If you're smart, you'll understand
20508 If you want to be a magician
20510 oh! Can you give me some demon souls!
20511 To be able to see even in old age
20512 How wonderful!
20513 Thank you, you great magician.
20514 As promised, I will give you new magic.
20520 oh! Can you give me another demon soul!
20521 Thank you, you great magician.
20522 I will give you new magic
20523 …Now you can get closer to the demon soul again…
20524 …the work of a wonderful man…
20526 Give me another demon soul
20527 I'll be waiting for you, you excellent magician.
20530 I don't mind anytime, give me some demon souls
20531 I've been waiting impatiently for you, good magician
20540 As far as I know, there are three people who have become demon leaders as humans.
20541 Orlant, King of Boletaria, Astraea of Rotvale, and Yellow Old Man of Latria
20542 A person can become a demon
20543 It's just an unfounded assumption that they're outsiders...
20550 At the end of that prison, I was defeated by the yellow old man and became a prisoner.
20551 Be careful. That old man controls Soul
20552 Manipulate dark souls with paranoia and madness
20560 Are you related to the monks, sir?
20561 They'll call me and magic bad, but I don't care
20562 Prayer is the salvation of fools, a pitiful act...
20563 ...don't know what their god is...
20570 That lady over there, Lady Yuria's magic, is very interesting.
20571 Her magic is different from mine, it feels more like a work of emotion, a miracle.
20572 Or maybe it's because she's a woman...
20573 Is it all because of my short hands...
20580 As you know, magic is the work of the soul.
20581 If Boletaria's Calamity, on the other hand, is activating souls and strengthening magic...
20582 Or maybe this is a scourge to sustain...
20583 No, sorry, please forget
20584 Demons rob people of their souls and rob their minds
20585 That's totally unacceptable...
20591 Are you
20592 I was saved in Latria. Grateful
20593 However, my old body is unlikely to be of any use to you...
20600 I don't care, go ahead
20601 If this leg starts moving, I'll escape to the temple of the wedge.
20610 Sir, have you killed all the demons?
20611 This roaring sound...because a high-ranking monk said it...
20612 I've been thinking all along
20613 Should I really seal the old beast?
20614 And I found out
20615 OK, sir. Do not seal the old beast
20616 If that Fire Keeper tries to seal the beast, kill that girl.
20617 And get the soul of the beast
20618 That's an extraordinarily silly thing that collects souls from all demons.
20619 You will have the power of a king, and I will have great knowledge.
20620 That is truly the right way. Don't be swept away
20621 Seek the soul of a demon!
20622 … That girl is, after all, invaded by demons. Death would be the salvation...
20630 Sir, where are you going?
20640 Sir, what are you doing!
20641 Killing me won't do you any good!
20650 Sir, where are you going?
20660 Sir, what are you doing!
20661 Killing me won't do you any good!
21000 Are you normal? Where are you from?
21001 Oh, I won't pry. Instead, would you like to buy my collection?
21002 Even though she looks like this, she was originally the wife of an aristocrat. I have enough things
21010 thank you
21011 With this, I won't have to go upstairs for a while...
21020 yeah... well, it can't be helped
21021 'Cause I've been here forever... I need soul to be sane. Do you understand?
21030 Oh you Will you buy me something again?
21032 Where are you going? Hey!
21034 You're back...can you buy me something?
21040 A lot of people besides me were trapped here.
21041 But everyone went crazy and went up on their own accord
21042 There is no such thing as salvation...
21050 The Queen banished that shabby old man
21051 But the old man returned with the demons in a strange yellow robe.
21052 You trampled that wonderful Latria and locked us in this prison.
21053 After that, my soul was slowly squeezed out every day.
21054 If you go upstairs, you will be saved.
21060 The person who used to treat me well said
21061 The goddess of the church is said to revive any number of times
21062 That's why ordinary people can't go to the top...
21070 are you going to kill me too?
21071 Why! Why!
22000 oh! Are you a decent human being? Was saved
22001 I could see a lot of treasure under that hole, but I couldn't do anything by myself, and I was having a hard time.
22002 Just take a peek, it's a great treasure
22003 Look, it's that hole. Come closer and take a look
22005 What happened?
22006 First, peek through that hole and check the treasure.
22007 That's what the strategy is for. Hehehe
22010 Hehe, don't feel bad
22011 I'll sell the treasures I've stripped from your corpse at a high price.
22012 Uhyahhyahhhhh!
22020 oh you...
22021 It wasn't bad, it wasn't bad
22022 Please forgive me. Cooperate 'cause I won't do anything wrong
22023 Let's get along with a few people, shall we?
22024 See, this is how I feel. You know what?
22026 heh heh
22027 Well, let's get along, dude
22028 Hell is also up to you
22030 Damn it!
22031 what did i do
22040 Oh, you i met you again
22041 ... don't be alarmed. The previous one was bad, I'm still reflecting on it
22042 I have a better story than that
22043 Can you see a lot of treasure under that hole? I couldn't do anything by myself, I was having a hard time
22044 Just take a peek, it's a great treasure
22100 Oh, you i met you again
22101 ... don't be alarmed. The previous one was bad, I'm still reflecting on it
22102 yeah, how about this?
22103 I was the first to find the treasure over there, but I'll leave it to you
22104 Besides, I won't move until you get close to the treasure.
22105 Not bad, right? I want to make up with you too
22107 what up? Strange guy, aren't you interested in treasure?
22110 Oh, oh Big tardigrades are also troublesome
22111 Well, it can't be helped. give up that you're out of luck
22112 As promised, the treasure is yours. well then, good luck
22113 Good Luck!
22120 Oh, you are amazing...
22121 This time it's different, just a coincidence. you were out of luck
22122 And you're fine after all. No count, no count
22123 Look, this is the treasure I just got
22124 Take it away, no, no, no
22130 heh heh
22131 Well, it's okay to be out of luck, don't give up
22132 I also have this lucky patch
22140 Hey, where are you going!
22145 what up? What a strange guy, why don't you touch the token of friendship?
22147 what up? Strange guy, aren't you interested in treasure?
22150 Oh, are you decent?
22151 Tekoto is a valuable travel companion. i'm patch nice to meet you
22152 …Yes, can you see the treasure over there? I'll give it to you
22153 Well, it's a token of friendship
22154 I'm glad everyone was staring blankly at me and I was going crazy
22156 Oh, you are amazing...
22160 Oh, you are amazing...
22161 But, of course, the treasure is yours
22162 I didn't have any luck with the big tardigrade, but in the end it turned out all right.
22163 Look, this is the treasure I just got
22164 Take it away, na, na, he, hehehehehe
22167 Oh, you are amazing...
22168 But, of course, the treasure is yours
22170 oh you
22171 That's right, I have some loot. It's full of treasure
22172 If it's for you, I'll give it away for cheap
22175 Good for you. If there is an opportunity, I will ask you again. because we are comrades
22177 …Well, I wouldn't say it's impossible. I think it's a waste, but hey
22180 oh dear i've been waiting
22181 I bought an amazing treasure. i hope i can help you
22185 It was amazing. It's hard to come by, thank you
22187 …Well, I wouldn't say it's impossible. Don't you know the value of this?
22189 How are you? You want to worship me? Hehehehe
22191 …I see…Well, it can’t be helped. Even so, he doesn't know the value of things...
22200 oh dear i've been waiting
22201 Hehehe, this treasure is really amazing
22202 I guarantee that you will want to worship the lucky patch
22210 Ah, all I'm selling right now are decent products
22211 I've already given up pretending to be a thief
22212 I'm serious now...I'm not ashamed of my mother, is it true?
22213 …Hey, is that true?
22220 There are priest priests over there, right?
22221 They still hate the shrine
22222 It seems that there are some big bosses, but they're not at all refreshing.
22223 I don't know what God did, but if prayer makes you happy, no one will suffer
22230 I heard some bad rumors
22231 The Lord of Silence, the Yurt, seems to be invading Boletaria.
22232 He cares nothing about human life, he's the worst assassin
22233 I don't know what to say, but it's not decent...
22234 I will advise you as a friend. Beware the yurt of black armor
22240 you go to rotten valley
22241 Over there lay the corpses of naive paladins who tried to pour their shame on them.
22242 There are some big ones inside. Like Bito the Knight of the Moonlight or Isterel from Lizaia
22243 They're only equipped with luxury. If you're lucky, I think you'll get good stuff.
22250 Damn it!
22251 what did i do
22260 Damn it!
22261 what did i do
22270 Hey, where are you going!
22280 Hey, where are you going!
24000 …it was helpful
24001 I will remember your face
24002 Sometimes it looks like...
24010 oh you
24011 that's fine, i was looking for it
24012 My name is Yurt, Lord of Silence. assassin
24013 By request, kill all humans who have sneaked into Boletaria.
24014 ...it's finally your turn
24020 Curiosity kills a cat, it's a dreamy thing...
24030 …Are you an enemy of demons?
24031 If so, get me out of here
24032 My thoughts are with you... first and foremost, to fight demons
24040 …Are you an enemy of demons?
24041 If so, get me out of here
24042 My thoughts are with you... first and foremost, to fight demons
24050 What are you doing?
24051 Remember! Sir!
24060 Are you...
24061 I was taken care of in Latria
24062 Thanks to you, I was able to return to this temple.
24063 …Now you can continue your mission
24064 I must express my gratitude to you...
24070 what?
24071 I have no use for you yet.
24072 There's nothing to worry about...
24073 Life is more fleeting than you think...
24080 What are you doing?
24081 Don't rush to death!
24090 You...
24091 Are you saying that Mephisto isn't a knothole either...
24100 What do you mean?
24101 Don't rush to death!
24110 You...
25000 Hey, hey, scary, people
25001 Give me a sparkle, give me a sparkle
25002 I can do it
25003 So give it to me. shiny, sparkly
25010 Hey, hey, scary, people
25011 shiny, thank you, thank you
25012 But I can still exchange
25013 So give it to me. shiny, sparkly
25014 Hey, please give me, give me
25020 Hey, hey, scary, people
25021 That's not shiny
25022 Give me a sparkle, give me a sparkle
25023 I can do it
25030 Hey, hey, scary, people
25031 I don't need that anymore
25032 Give me a sparkle, give me a sparkle
25033 I can do it
25034 So give it to me. shiny, sparkly
25035 Hey, please give me, give me
25040 shiny, thank you, thank you
25050 That's not shiny
25060 I don't need that anymore
25061 Give me a sparkle, give me a sparkle
25070 Hey, hey, scary, people
25071 shiny, thank you, thank you
26000 oh you
26001 Have you calmed down my dark soul?
26002 Thanks to God who sent you and above all to you
26003 Ambassa
26499 oh you
26500 Thanks to you, I was able to escape to this temple.
26501 Now, together with the believers of God gathered here, I pray for those who fight demons.
26502 If you would like further assistance, please donate Vulgar Souls or Defiled Demon's Souls.
26503 We will exorcise it and make it your strength.
26510 is that so
26511 But don't forget. Soul is the evil power of demons.
26520 oh is it you
26521 Can you donate anything else?
26530 Bless the hero who fights for God
26531 Ambassa
26533 is that so
26534 I will never force you to donate
26535 But don't forget. Soul is, in other words, the evil power of demons.
26540 As you know, souls are magical powers that come from demons.
26541 It was the king of Orlant who was swallowed up by that power, and the current Boletaria.
26542 Old Flake and that firefighter's daughter are no exception...
26550 If you too are a follower of God, you will have a divine image, a talisman.
26551 In Boletaria, talismans manifest divine miracles
26552 God has given special powers to this cursed land.
26553 It is nothing but God's will to demons
26559 oh you
26560 Thanks to you, I was able to escape to this temple.
26561 Now, together with the believers of God gathered here, we pray for those who fight demons.
26562 God bless you
26563 Ambassa
26570 Oh, were you also deceived by that man?
26571 So am I. Deceived and trapped by that man
26572 From the reaction, it seems that this is leading to the outside...
26573 A terrible, dark soul stands in your way
26574 But eventually the will of God will exorcise it
26575 please pray with me
26576 Ambassa
26580 Where are you going?
26590 what are you doing
26591 No...! Have you been swallowed by the power of Soul!? ?
26600 stop it
26601 I feel God's wrath
26610 God's miracles were also found when witchcraft was rampant
26611 God's will is now clear
26612 After defeating the demons and breaking Boletaria's curse
26613 We need to get rid of the mages who control cursed souls.
26620 Astraea of Rot Valley?
26621 I don't know the details, but the Saint of the West, Astraea, must have been followed by a knight from Vinland.
26622 There's no way that there's that famous knight in dark silver armor that wards off malice and she's swallowed up by the power of souls.
26623 Probably some kind of malicious slander. Alas, there are scumbags everywhere
26630 Bito the Knight of the Moonlight, Isterel of Lizaia, and Seren Vinland
26631 A number of Holy Knights have secretly entered Boletaria and made their way to Rot Valley.
26632 Rumors of Astraea, even malicious slander, dishonor God's honor.
26633 …but no one is coming back
26634 Is that filthy land filled only with the malice of demons, without even the will of God reaching it?
26635 …Or is it the resentment of those who were abandoned by the gods…
26650 What is this howl...
26651 It's not the voice of an evil one, like a demon
26652 Like a hungry innocent baby...
26653 Do you know anything?
26654 For some reason, I can't help but feel anxious...
26655 god bless. Blessed be Boletaria
26656 Ambassa
26660 Where are you going?
26670 what are you doing
26671 No...! Have you been swallowed by the power of Soul!? ?
26680 stop it
26681 I feel God's wrath
27000 After all, can't we go back?
27001 If you really want to hurt her, it can't be helped
27002 Let it rot in the depths of the earth
27010 Astra Air...
27020 Why do you guys want to harm us?
27021 Of course, even though you and others threw it away
27022 we just live quietly
27030 Did you fall...
27031 Just like that, it's better to be eaten and killed by the unclean people...
27040 don't touch us
27041 If that's the case, there's nothing I can do for you...
28000 to slay my demons
28001 How many souls have you stolen with your human body?
28002 … well. If the beast wants you, you may see it again
28500 Called by the Beast
28501 Looking for Demon's Souls? Or was it tempted by a high-ranking boy?
28502 Either way, I'm a first-time pilgrim. let's welcome
28510 you've seen it too
28511 Of course, the world is a tragedy
28512 Therefore, God left the poison of the beast
28513 To take the soul and end all tragedies!
28520 you…
28521 don't you know...
28522 No one really wants...
28530 Enough is enough, a world rotten by malice...
29000 Come back, demon slayer
29001 This is the place where those who have been abandoned by God gather
29002 There's nothing in this land for you to take
29003 I beg you. please return
29010 I'm sorry, Gal Vinland.
29011 be safe
29020 Oh my god...
29021 why are you stealing from us...
29030 stop…
29031 stop it…
29040 we just live here
29041 What do you tell me you did...
29050 oh my god
29051 Can't you just throw them away?
29052 Why do you hate us so much?
29060 please come back
29061 Otherwise he will have no mercy on you
29070 you…
29071 That person died...
29072 I understand... my resistance would be meaningless.
29073 Now, take the desired Demon's Soul
29080 … oh god
29081 you are cruel...
29082 Are you sorry for abandoning us...
30000 Hi!
30001 …What?
30002 I'm Skillville. Seeking unseen treasure
30003 But I've come this far
30004 Good intuition or just reckless, well, talent is the same
30010 …let’s bet on that talent
30011 Do you know the underground temple ahead?
30012 It is a work of art carved by the predecessors of the diggers to sink the keel.
30013 So, in case of emergency, that temple is equipped with a single sword to crush dragon bones and kill dragons.
30014 Of course, the sword is dull in name only. A silly joke for swordsmiths
30015 Haha, dull dragon slayer, you're attracted to me, aren't you?
30016 ...If the demon isn't there, I'll find it myself, but I'm not very good at fighting.
30017 If you get that sword, just one look, let me worship it
30020 Hi!
30021 …What are you?
30030 I see, I can't find it... Maybe it's already been taken from this land...
30031 Or maybe it was melted into lava... it's a waste...
30038 Hey it!
30039 Did you find it!
30040 Show me better!
30050 …wonderful. As a sword, the best of technology has been concentrated in a direction that is completely unnecessary...
30051 … huh…
30052 …huh…
30053 …heh…
30054 … Oh, I’m sorry. thank you i enjoyed it
30055 This is just a thank you, keep it
30056 Please take good care of that sword. it's a good thing, it's
30060 But it's amazing, this pit
30061 A dragon's corpse producing ore, it's a beautiful story, isn't it?
30070 daemon? oh sorry i'm not interested
30071 The reason I'm drawn to Boletaria is because it's unusual here.
30072 Strange places attract weird people and strange things
30073 To be honest, I don't think it's okay to stay like this forever...
30074 Haha, that's a shameful story
30075 I'm sorry. don't get angry
30080 Whoa, what happened to you!
30081 Killing me is no good!
30090 Let's disguise ourselves! Stop it!
31004 what happened?
31005 Do you also seek the power of souls?
31010 …Do you also seek the power of souls?
31011 …got it. Please sit in front of me and touch my heart
31012 please…
31014 Seek the power of the soul
31015 Now touch the demon inside me
31020 got it
31021 because you need power
31022 …touch the demon inside me
31023 Let the soul that has lost its master be a part of you
31025 …Is that so
31026 …sorry
31027 I misunderstood you. please forgive me
31030 The truth of all living things that will no longer return to the Lord
31031 Understanding in relationship and the power of the soul that mediates it
31032 Give this person a chance, and thus make it a side of the world.
31033 Therefore, let the world come close
31040 …Did you finish?
31041 May you be the side of the world
31050 On top of this, the key person is waiting for you
31051 Please listen to Kaname's story and learn the meaning of the wedge...
31060 I hear a familiar voice...
31061 the beast is calling you...
31062 Together, let's go to the beast...
31065 Together, let's go to the beast...
31070 Beast...here we are...
31071 You want a new demon...
31072 Come on, you're a good boy...
31080 …that’s all
31081 Those who kill demons, please go back to the top.
31082 No more wedges to hold you
31083 I bring the beast back to slumber
31084 Thanks to you, I was able to look like a lovely beast
31090 A strong soul that can truly die
31091 Please guide the old beast to sleep again---
31100 I'll be waiting for you again, who kills the demon
31101 I'm just there for you...
31110 …thank you
31111 Thanks to you, I can finally finish my role――――
31120 Beast! A nostalgic beast!
31121 I brought a new demon for you
31122 You want a demon?
31123 yes, that's fine
31124 Keep calm
31125 You know, beast...
31130 Beast, now all demons are lost...
31131 But You Don't Need No More Daemons
31132 you sleep with me That's how we should be...
31133 …thanks to you, demon slayer
31134 Thanks to you, I can sleep too
31135 Please go back to your world
31140 I sleep long with the beast, let us return to what we should be
31141 Please go back to your world
31150 I...?
31151 i'm just a firefighter
31152 For you demon-slayers, I keep the light of this temple
31160 I've been in this wedge all along
31161 From the end of that slumber to the time of another slumber――――
31170 Ah... (Subdued scream)
31172 Ugh... (Subdued scream)
31174 Kyah (death mourning)
31176 Ah... which way...
31180 …sorry
31181 …I cannot die
31182 As long as this wedge keeps me connected...
31190 …sorry
31191 …I cannot die
31192 As long as this wedge keeps me connected...
32500 I've been waiting for you, demon slayer
32501 I'm an important person. I am the one who holds the world together
32502 I have something to say to you
32503 We also fought demons in the past...
32510 is that so. That's good
32511 Now kill all demons
32512 A beast that has lost its soul-supplying servant will seek a new servant and guide you on its own.
32514 I'll give you this. It will surely help you in your fight
32520 is that so. It is a pity
32521 Then you will be bound to this temple forever
32522 just like that firefighter
32530 you are like we used to be
32531 The old beast must be brought back to slumber and sealed
32532 Otherwise the world will disappear in a thick fog
32533 can you hear my wish?
32540 Soul is the ether through which living things think and understand the world.
32541 Therefore, creatures deprived of this will starve for thought, and the world that has lost its understanding will be swallowed up by a dense fog and disappear.
32542 The Old Beast is a bottomless emptiness that continues to spawn demons, steal souls, and accumulate within itself.
32543 Absolutely no way to get along with us creatures
32550 We have sealed the beasts, forbidden the knowledge of souls, and anchored the world with keystones and dignitaries.
32551 But time is long, and people are stupid and fleeting creatures.
32552 Many of the dignitaries were lost, the keystones were forgotten
32553 And that humble Orlant reawakened the old beast.
32560 If the Beast is Sealed, Soul's Karma is Lost
32561 Soul is something that floats quietly within us and serves as food for thought.
32562 please don't forget
32563 The powerful, physical state you now know is the work of demons, far removed from the essence of souls.
32570 You killed all demons
32571 you can hear the roar of the beast
32572 Go with the Fire Keeper to the old beast under this wedge
32573 Then she will lead the beast back to slumber
32574 ...That's why it was trapped in a wedge.
32580 ha ha ha
32581 stop doing useless things
32582 I'm not a VIP, already a person
32590 Gaaaaaa
32591 That's right... I'm an important person...
32600 Does the Fire Keeper help you a lot?
32601 It's trapped in this wedge to help those who kill demons and guide old beasts to slumber again.
32602 If not, like a demon or something...
32610 Did you go upstairs in the hall of fame?
32611 It enshrines the souls of demon-slayers who fought just like you.
32612 Sooner or later your soul will be enshrined in that hall of fame
32613 that's all we can do now
32614 To the heroes who forced us to fight because of our sins...
32620 Hahahahaha
32622 Hahahahahahaha
32630 …Kill all the demons if you want to escape the curse of the wedge.
32631 Then the beast that has lost its soul-supplying servant will seek a new servant and guide you on its own.
32632 You bring the beast back to slumber for you
32640 … you must hate me
32641 But we dignitaries are also bound by this wedge.
32642 …to hold your world together
32650 …sorry. Can I meditate for a moment?
32651 Otherwise, the dignitaries will not be able to keep their thoughts
32653 …
32660 Really dying, strong soul
32661 lead you to the wedge temple
32662 To bring the old beast back to sleep――――
33500 Huh, another person entered the rift
33501 Did you ask for Demon's Souls? Or are you trying to save the country?
33502 Well, it's the same either way. You too are trapped in this temple
33503 As a demon slayer with a strong soul
33504 … Hahahahaha
33506 If it's the demon you want, I'll be there with you beyond this keystone.
33507 Come on, let's go. Is that what you're here for? In this cursed Galantaria
33510 Heh, I didn't think he was still alive
33511 Well then, let me tell you a good story
33512 In this temple, there is a girl dressed in black. A brooding fire-keeper with waxed eyes
33513 That girl manipulates Seoul like a stranger
33514 If you ask for it, I'll give you the souls I stole from the hungry people and demons as your flesh and blood.
33515 And everyone becomes a monster...
33520 oh you
33521 How many other people are there in this temple?
33522 everyone is like me
33523 Embracing something, I enter the rift of fog, realizing my powerlessness, and yet I am still trapped in this temple...
33530 What are you
33531 The priests and the magicians are fighting each other even in this temple.
33532 They never sit where they can see each other
33533 It's funny After all, what are the stragglers pretending to be?
33540 what are you scared of
33541 Then just like me, forget everything and just sit here forever
33542 nothing, but at least it's safe
33543 … Hahahahaha
33550 Have you met a high-ranking monk?
33551 They resurrected old beasts on their own accord.
33552 After all, it's the silly self-sacrifice and sense of duty that bind us to this temple.
33553 Absolutely terrible story...
33560 If you're a firefighter, you've just gone upstairs.
33561 Well, let's go. Monsters should get along well
33562 What, it's none of my business...
33570 you don't know my body Has it rotted away?
33580 …I’m sorry, but will you disappear…
33590 … oh… who? I forgot all about it...
33600 What are you doing?
33601 No matter how much I am, if I get cut, I will resist!
33610 … Huh. Can't you just talk to me
33611 A monster! You're in a good mood!
33620 yeah? what?
33621 I'm just here Is there a problem?
33630 Hahaha, yeah, are you dead?
33631 In Cursed Boletaria, even after death souls are bound to this temple
33632 So what are you going to do? Are you going to give up like this?
33633 …I did
33634 It's a pitiful story, but it's because my heart is broken...
33650 …Hou, did you get Demon's Souls?
33651 I envy you
33652 Now you can get closer to the monster again
33653 Hahahahahahaha
33654 It's all their way!
35000 oh you're a sane person
35001 I'm selenium came from the west
35002 I'm looking for my younger brother Gar Vinland, who went on a journey with Astraea.
35003 I heard that the two finally ended up here.
35004 If you find my brother, please let me know
35005 …I have to tell my brother my father's last words
35010 That coat of arms!
35011 It's an heirloom of Vinland given to him by his brother.
35012 …Is that so, my brother and Astraea-sama both disobeyed God’s will…
35013 Poor thing, maybe they were too naive, those two...
35014 Ambassa
35020 Thank you, traveling warrior
35021 As an older sister, I thank you for honoring my younger brother.
35022 This is at least a thank you. I prepared it for my brother, but now it won't come true.
35023 God bless you
35024 Ambassa
35030 Thank you, traveling warrior
35031 As an older sister, I thank you for honoring my younger brother.
35035 This is at least a thank you. Please use it for your future trip
35040 Can you give me a memento of my brother
35041 Of course, I would like to thank you
35050 …is that so
35051 But it's just a crest with no power
35052 I need it just to mourn my brother
35053 Could you please reconsider
35060 …is that so
35061 Well then, it can't be helped. This may also be Gull's fault
35062 I look for a way to return home
35063 you too
35064 I wish you safe travels...
35070 journey warrior
35071 I would like to make a bold request, but could you give me that crest?
35072 Garu was unworthy, but I want to mourn him as Vinland along with mementos.
35073 Of course, I would like to thank you
35080 What happened!
35081 I am not your enemy!
35090 …This place is a strange place, isn’t it?
35091 Even though it is so full of uncleanness, it seems that it is not impure.
35100 I heard some bad rumors about Astraea.
35101 Did you know? It's from a woman who sells medicinal herbs.
35102 I don't think he's a bad person either, but I can't believe that Astraea-sama is a demon...
36000 oh human
36001 My name is Rydell. Please, let me out of this prison
36002 I don't have time anymore There is something precious left in that body...
36010 yeah, don't you have one? It's not so convenient
36020 Yes, can't you find it? No wonder...
36030 No... it's not that kind of key...
36040 The key is... I've never seen it before... Maybe it's what I'm looking for...
36041 Can you give me that key? let me thank you
36050 Thank you! thanks so much
36051 This is at least a thank you. It's a gem, but I don't need it anymore
36052 Oh, is this finally the end...
36054 Oh, is this finally the end...
36060 yeah it's a shame
36061 I don't want to kill people anymore
36070 Lord Black of the frontier has also fallen.
36071 I lost the battle, and I'm still not finished with regrets...
36080 I'm sorry you guys...
36090 oh oh oh oh oh (roar)
36092 Whoever you are, open up here!
36094 Hey! Whoa!
36100 As you can see, I'm only soul now
36101 The body will be imprisoned in another prison and already rotten
36102 I don't have any regrets about my body anymore, but I've left a memento of my wife on that body.
36103 My soul was also weakened. At least in the end, I want to be by her side...
36110 The key to this prison was taken long ago by the king's envoy.
36111 While the black pig shakes its fat belly...
36120 What happened, suddenly! please stop!
36121 I don't want to kill people anymore!
36122 And you are a benefactor!
37000 Seeker of the royal sword
37001 Show your power and the worth of your soul before the old king.
37005 Prepare yourself, seeker
37010 splendid, seeker
37011 Take the royal sword ahead
37012 The Old King, Doran's Approval
37020 Slaughter the old king. that's good too
37021 Savagery is also a quality of a king if you study it
37022 But...
39500 you…
39501 your hands are too pretty
39502 no business
39510 You killed some people...
39511 Well, of course. Demon's Souls is worth it
39512 …then do you see the value of my story?
39515 …Will you kill Ariana, the Prince of Orlando, who calls herself Ostrava?
39517 Of course, prepare an exceptional reward
39518 How is it?
39519 It doesn't matter what the reason is if you think it will reduce the number of competitors.
39522 that's good, i'm looking forward to it
39530 Huh, I see... Well, call me if you change your mind
39531 That said, I can't stay too long...
39540 what up?
39541 It's not a particularly difficult request.
39550 I see, excellent. unforgiving
39551 This is a reward, please accept it. It's not meant to be in the hands of someone like you.
39553 Then the next request
39555 Kill Ariana, Prince of Orlando who calls herself Ostrava
39557 Of course, let's prepare a similar reward
39560 Hmm, are you done?
39561 Thank you. keep it
39563 Don't look so wistful, I still have a request
39565 Next, kill Ariana, Prince of Orlando, who calls herself Ostrava.
39567 Do you have any hesitation already?
39570 yeah is it all over
39571 It was a lot of work
39572 After you die, Soul's secrets won't be leaked...
39580 Was the fool thinking that he was the only one who was special?
39590 You, won't you kill Bior of the Twin Swords?
39592 Kill Bior the Twin Sword
39594 Next, kill Bior of the Twin Swords
39600 Why don't you kill the sage Freki and his apprentice?
39602 Kill Sage Freke and his Apprentice
39604 Next, kill Sage Flake and his apprentice.
39610 You, won't you kill the witch Yuria?
39612 kill witch yuria
39614 Next, kill the witch Yuria
39620 Will you kill Saint Urbain and his followers?
39622 Kill Saint Urbain and his followers
39624 Now kill Saint Urbain and his followers
39630 Won't you kill Thomas the Big Sack?
39632 kill sack thomas
39634 Now kill big bag Thomas
39640 you don't kill the hyena patch
39642 kill the hyena patch
39644 Now kill the hyena patch
39650 What do you mean...
39660 Absolutely useless idiots...
39670 what up?
40000 You... you seem like a decent human being
40001 I am Satsuki. looking for a memento of my father
40002 If you find a sword with the inscription "Makoto", please let me know.
40003 In exchange, offer a valuable Demon's Soul
40010 Makoto is the sword that chooses the master
40011 don't think weird
40012 It's not something that normal people can use.
40020 Ho, did you find "Makoto"?
40021 It was a lucky thing, but... well, it was hard work.
40022 Well then, let me give you my sincerity
40030 oh this is it
40031 It's this sparkle... I finally got it, kuk-kuk-kuk
40032 But... if you don't kill people, you don't know the value of a sword, do you?
40033 I guess you know...
40040 What are you doing?
40041 Don't bother me, don't you want Demon's Souls?
40050 Huh, got it!
40051 If that's the case, it's up to you to take it with your strength!
40060 What are you doing!
40061 It doesn't look like life is worth it!
40070 Hmm...you're going to use "Makoto"...
40071 To stain a famous sword with the dirt of a shogun's hand...
40072 It must have blown you up a lot, you madman!
40080 As expected, it is "Makoto". Not even one broken blade
40081 Kukuku, Kukuku, huh
40090 The idiot is the revenge...
40100 Hey you!
40101 Hmm, it seems like a decent human being
40102 Come over here. I have a story
40103 …Do not worry. nice talk
41000 Hahahahahahaha (lol)
41001 Fools who know no rules!
41002 Idols are resurrected over and over again
41003 Follow the wishes of those ignorant people!
41004 Hahahahahahaha (lol)
41010 Wha, what are you?
41011 I'm just a maid. I will not disturb you
41012 I don't mind
41020 What are you doing!
41021 I'm just a maid!
41030 No, please stop!
41031 hee hee hee
42500 Are you a demon challenger?
42501 If that's the case, please save the sage Freki-sama, who is trapped in Latria's prison.
42502 Let's help as much as we can. If it's simple magic, I can teach you
42503 He is the light of man, but I am not strong enough...
42510 Are you asking me to teach you magic, sir?
42520 Use it carefully
42521 Originally, it's not a power that you should have in your hands.
42522 It's unavoidable for Flake-sama's sake, but...
42530 I see... that's fine
42531 Hurry up and save Freke.
42534 You said you helped Mr. Freke, didn't you?
42535 It was worth breaking the rules and teaching you magic.
42536 anyway, thank you
42537 You will find out soon enough. the greatness of their deeds
42540 what? Sir, do you still want to learn magic?
42541 … well, it can’t be helped
42542 It's probably better than making a fuss about Mr. Flake's collar.
42550 Freki-sama is a great sage who systematized the soul's work of magic and turned it into a human work.
42551 The current Boletaria and the demons will greatly aid Flake-sama's thinking.
42552 That's why I have to welcome Mr. Freke as soon as possible...
42560 I? Of course, I tried to rescue Mr. Flake.
42561 But I wasn't strong enough. That's it
42562 Besides, if I push myself too hard, who will tell him about his plight?
42564 Mr. Frekke prefers to be alone
42565 You don't talk to me too lightly either.
42566 That person's thoughts are more valuable than Demon's Souls.
42570 What are you?
42571 I have no use for idiots like you. go away, go away
42580 Hey, sir, where are you going!
42590 Hey, we're still talking!
42600 What are you doing!
42610 Damn you, are you out of your mind!
42611 Stop it!
42620 Use it carefully
42630 I see... that's fine
43500 i am a sinful man
43501 I obeyed a noble person, but I couldn't do anything...
43502 I abandoned my precious person and ran away...
43510 god punish me
43511 In this body without courage, even self-punishment is not possible
43520 … Oh, what happened to the precious person?
43521 In that darkness where not even the faint light of water can reach...
43522 are you still praying
43530 I can't forgive that hyena-like man
43531 Behind the altar of the shrine, he deceived us and kicked the venerable into that darkness.
43532 …and I ran away from that place, throwing everything away…
43540 Ah, you saved a precious person
43541 Sincerely thank. This is the end of my redemption
43542 oh my god
43543 Ambassa
43550 Have you heard rumors of Astraea, Maiden of Rotvale?
43551 Together with the knights who serve her, she blasphemes God, becomes a demon, and deceives the lowly.
43552 Of course, it's a baseless rumor. That valley must be full of God's defiled malice
43553 …but if it’s true
43554 …she will be punished forever for dishonoring God.
43560 Lord Urbain will be back and the mages will be quiet.
43561 If there is a divine miracle shown by that person, a hero like you who fights demons will no longer have to resort to magic.
43562 That's right. A demon-fighting hero is not willing to be a criminal
43570 Are you related to that hyena patch?
43571 I won't stop That's mean and not the man you should be dealing with
43572 Heroes have the right friends
43573 For example, someone like Urbain
43580 that? where are you going?
43581 i'm still talking
43590 what are you doing
43600 No, please stop!
43610 Harm the followers of God! No punishment!
44500 oh you are a servant of god
44501 Like you, I am continuing my journey against demons for God's sake.
44502 If you please, I will share the power of God with you. We believe in the same God, so don't hold back
44510 Miracles are God's work
44511 Please act accordingly
44520 Oh me, you want the power of God
44522 Do you want divine power?
44524 you're still talking
44525 You are a rude person, I am disappointed
44527 What are you doing!
44528 Our enemies are demons!
44530 …I see, so you want a merciless ordeal. that would be nice too
44531 I hope to see you again
44540 Do you want divine power?
44541 I don't mind, but please also ask for Master Urbain's teachings.
44542 For he hears the voice of God
44550 Are you asking Master Urbain to teach you?
44551 Good thing. please do so
44560 Miracles are works of God. Magic, on the other hand, is the art of souls, the art of demons.
44561 Even if their manifestations are similar, isn't it self-evidently clear which one is beneficial to humans and which one is harmful to humans?
44562 A sorcerer is not far from a demon's servant
44570 Do you know Master Urbain?
44571 He is a true saint who hears the voice of God
44572 But that sissy follower said he was trapped somewhere in the shrine.
44573 Such a wonderful person is hard work
44574 I'm thinking of heading to the shrine soon to rescue Master Urbain.
44575 Because that's my mission as God's servant
44576 I won't be able to see you for a while.
44580 you are a traveling warrior
44581 Victory to those who resist demons
44582 Ambassa
45500 oh how did this happen
45501 Has God abandoned us, who are inadequate...
45502 Oh ambassador...
45510 It is said that if you are attacked by a terrifying demon, you will cease to be a human.
45511 Is this at least salvation?
45520 is it you I'm not lost anymore
45521 I will take care of Lord Urbain and pray with him.
45522 for God's sake. Ambassa
45530 oh i still can't believe
45531 That I'm helping save the world...
45532 Oh Urbain...
45533 Ambassa
45540 I used to live in the castle town of Boletaria
45541 When King Orlant went into hiding and returned with fearsome demons
45542 All attacked by demons and starving people
45543 It's scary and I can't really remember
45544 What would I have been without my grandfather's memento, the miracle stone fragment...
45550 do you know?
45551 It is said that if attacked by a demon, it will cease to be a human.
45552 Oh, how terrifying it is that a man ceases to be a man
45553 I can't imagine...
45554 Ambassa
45560 my grandfather was a bit of a dilettante
45561 It seems that he also went in and out of Stone Fang and collected rare stones.
45562 I thought most of them were worthless junk
45563 That miracle stone fragment saved me
45564 Is this also God's arrangement...
45570 oh god didn't forsake me
45571 To be able to introduce you to that wonderful Urbain-sama.
45572 I will take care of Lord Urbain and pray with him.
45573 That's the will of God that kept me alive
45574 Ambassa!
45580 I intend to hand over everything I own to Lord Urbain.
45581 There may be something like that miracle stone fragment in the junk left by my grandfather.
45582 Even if I have it, it won't do anything
45583 Lord Urbain will hear the voice of God
45590 I am with Lord Urbain
45591 God made me to be
45600 Um... where to...?
45610 Kyaah!
45620 Ouch!
45630 what are you doing stop it!
45640 oh you...
45641 I understand. You too will hear God's voice
45642 And you're fighting demons
45643 God must have sent you for us
45644 i give you everything i have
45645 God bless you
45646 Ambassa
45650 oh how did this happen
47500 This is Boletaria. An extraordinary world governed by the laws of Seoul
47501 There are no sane people anywhere, soul-hungry men and terrifying demons attack your soul.
47502 If you are wise, you will know. You came here to die, an offering
47503 If you want to avoid it, you have to know everything, right?
47504 I know. I will give you everything
47510 …that’s fine too. But, groping and wandering, do you think it's a place with life?
47520 Wise One, do you seek new knowledge?
47530 … Oh my God. pathetic stupidity
47540 …I know
47541 He who knows everything and therefore lives
47542 I'm not going to waste words on nonsense
47550 Come again, prisoner
47551 If you're just trying to avoid being an offering
47560 come again
47561 As long as you're alive, you still have things to know
47570 what a stupid...
47571 Boasting violence without meaning...
47580 Where are you going?
47581 Are you timid? To know everything...
48500 i'm thomas the big bag
48501 On that day of disaster, I found myself in this temple
48502 My wife and daughters were probably killed by demons.
48503 But I can't fight... at least I want to help you fight demons.
48504 If you don't mind, let me watch over the baggage I can't carry
48510 Leave your luggage to me. Man Thomas has no two words
48511 Good luck with that
48520 Oh you
48521 I've been keeping an eye on your luggage, it's okay
48530 You're a good person, come back alive
48540 were you okay
48541 I was worried about it, it's really good
48550 I'm sorry I made you fight...
48552 Hey, where are you going?
48554 what happened earlier? hurry over there
48560 On that day, I left my wife and children and ran away in a trance
48561 Before I knew it, I was thrown into this temple. Since then, I've never stepped out of here
48562 So, I'm sorry for being useless, but I don't know anything about things outside the temple...
48570 That fire protection girl took care of me when I was thrown out into the temple.
48571 If she's still alive, she'll be as old as my daughter. Taciturn but kind, good girl, that one
48572 But my eyes were blocked, and I was trapped in a place like this all the time...
48573 I'm sorry. I wonder if there's anything I can do...
48580 Oh, you, that hair ornament! That's my daughter...!
48581 …Is that so, was my daughter dead after all…
48582 …Ah, I have a favor to ask of you.
48583 Could you give me that hair ornament as a memento of my daughter?
48590 really!
48591 Thank you, thank you, thank you (Gusun)
48592 Oh, yes, thank you...
48593 Even though there is only this kind of thing, please accept it
48594 Actually, I was ashamed to say that I picked it up on the main street a long time ago.
48595 I feel some strange power...
48596 But if it's yours, the guy with the ring will be more excited.
48600 Really…
48601 yeah that's what you got
48602 Hahaha, I'm sorry, it's getting wet
48603 Hahahahaha
48610 Saints and sages, there are many fearful people in this temple.
48611 Everyone must be fighting demons and healing their wounds here.
48612 Those people are also fighting, so I have to do my best too.
48620 What's going on outside the temple now?
48621 People like you got rid of the demons
48622 Maybe it's time to go back in time...
48623 I hope so, but hey...
48630 sometimes i think
48631 why am i in this temple
48632 At that time, I thought I should have been killed by a demon before my wife and children.
48633 Hahaha, I'm sorry, it's a wet story
48640 By the way, you are an amazing person
48641 I'm going to fight those demons and get rid of them
48642 I wish I could fight...
48650 What are you doing!
48651 No, please stop!
49000 Hehehe, husband
49001 Soul, give me soul, exchange
49010 Hehehe, I'm begging you again, husband
49020 I can't be speechless...
49021 What? Husband?
49030 Hehehe, it's me, master
49031 There are good things, so please give me a lot, okay? Seoul, heh heh heh
49040 Hehehe, husband. Are you exchanging?
49050 Hehe, thank you. Husband, you're a good person, aren't you?
49052 Hehe, husband...
49053 I can't tease you...I hope this is all I have...
49055 Where are you going, husband?
49057 Hehehe, husband. Please stop joking...
49060 this town? Hehe, this place is nice
49061 Everyone has eyes like lizards, they're crazy about tinkering with rocks, and they don't care about me.
49062 Thanks to that, I can do as many things as I want. There's no better place than this, heh heh heh
49063 God exists, doesn't he? he was watching me
49070 Husband, do you know the glitter lizard?
49071 It's quick and runs away quickly, but it's carrying a nice stone.
49072 Ahh, I know his nest
49073 Ah, even my husband can't teach you all this, but hey, heh heh heh
49080 Hehehe, husband, do you know?
49081 At the bottom of this tunnel, there is a lot of dragon bones buried, and it is said that there is a shrine dedicated to the dragon god.
49082 Well, it's a pass from Skillville's husband.
49083 I can't go to such a place.
49084 On the day I met a tardigrade bastard, I'll whisper with a whisper, heh heh heh
49090 What are you doing!
49091 I'll do it when I have to, sir!
50000 yeah? New? Isn't that a customer?
50001 I'm Baldwin, a humble blacksmith
50002 Anyway, bring my soul to me
50003 If you want a weapon, I'll give it to you, and if you have ore, I'll make a weapon for you.
50004 For your cheap life and my precious life
50010 oh you
50011 If you want to forge weapons, you can always consult me, at a bargain price.
50020 I will come back alive. for the eagle
50030 what the heck
50031 A young monk can't live long, at all...
50033 Where are you going! Hey!
50034 Young priests these days don't even know manners!
50036 …a very rude young monk
50037 If I hadn't been gentle
50040 You probably don't know, but there's a bigoted blacksmith at the entrance to Fangsein Tunnel.
50041 His arms are okay, but he's just an oddball. There's only one person left in a town full of starving people
50042 Even if I say that if I ever meet him, I'm sure he's shut himself up anyway, that stubborn old man...
50050 This temple doesn't have enough smithing tools anyway.
50051 Well, even for forging weapons, the amount of ore that can be used is limited, but well, you have to put up with it.
50052 In the first place, it is because of my skill that I can work in blacksmithing in a place like this.
50070 Huh, Ed's old man, you still couldn't help it
50071 Haha, the demons are too much
50072 That's fine. Wow hahahahahahahaha
50080 There's a Dragon's Graveyard in the Fangsein Tunnel.
50081 Ores are seeping out from the dragon's corpse.
50090 When I was young, I was proud of my strength
50091 I used to beat up tardigrades at the request of the hole diggers.
50092 Of course, it's easy to die. I just threw it into the lava for the time being.
50093 Wow hahahahahahahaha
50100 My strength is pretty good, but old Ed's is more than that.
50101 He's a fool. I have no idea what to eat to become like that
50102 You too, just don't make that old man angry
50103 Far worse than a bad demon
50104 Wow hahahahahahahaha
50110 What are you doing!
50111 Did the young monk lose his mind?
50112 I'm the brawler, Bold Ruin!
